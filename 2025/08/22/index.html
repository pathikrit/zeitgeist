<h2>Macro &amp; Monetary Policy</h2>
<h3>Growth, Recession, and Inflation</h3>
<ul>
<li>A US recession before 2027 is a non-trivial but still minority scenario; an immediate 2025 recession looks unlikely, with low downside risk projected for the next year.</li>
<li>US and global growth are expected to be moderate with GDP forecasts clustering around 1–2.5% for 2025, notably lower than robust expansions—but little expectation of contraction.</li>
<li>Core and headline inflation for 2025 is widely expected to remain above the previously targeted “2%,” likely in the 2.6–4% band. Risks of a significant inflation spike (&gt;5%) are seen as quite limited, but sustained disinflation is also seen as unlikely.</li>
<li>Unemployment is projected to climb, potentially exceeding 4.2%, suggesting softer labor markets—but not enough to trigger a clear-cut downturn; payroll gains remain positive though less robust.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fed Policy &amp; Interest Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li>Short-term rates are expected to gradually moderate rather than spike: a December Fed funds rate in the 3.5–4.25% range is likely, with negligible odds of a major hike or drop this year.</li>
<li>For 2025, incremental rate cuts (one or two) remain the consensus, but there is strong skepticism about aggressive easing; the door to no rate cuts remains open if inflation stays sticky. Emergency action is seen as unlikely unless a crisis emerges.</li>
<li>The yield curve may remain relatively flat/remain slightly inverted, keeping refinancing costs and equity risk premia higher than the pre-pandemic average.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal Policy &amp; US Debt</h3>
<ul>
<li>US national debt will rise above $38T by year-end 2025, reinforcing a narrative of continued high deficit spending. Government shutdown risks remain meaningful, with increased volatility possible during budget negotiations.</li>
<li>The political environment is polarized, which could create periodic fiscal noise; actual abandonment of major taxes or abolition of the Fed is not considered credible.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectoral Impacts</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; Semiconductors</h3>
<ul>
<li>Despite rising layoff pressure through 2025, tech sector employment shakeout is not expected to materially threaten industry dominance but may create more volatility among growth names.</li>
<li>US semiconductor production will accelerate meaningfully in 2025, with double-digit output growth. However, elevated risks of new US tariffs imposed on semiconductors—especially those produced in/with China—are highly likely, raising near-term supply chain and cost uncertainties for hardware and electronics firms.</li>
<li>AI and chip investments remain a policy and business focus; some probability for an AI “safety” bill exists but not a near-certainty, so regulatory risk is rising but not overwhelming.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Renewables &amp; Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li>US solar capacity installations are on track for a solid growth year (~40 GWdc+ expected), furthering the ongoing transition but falling short of peak acceleration scenarios. This supports continued capital investment but may challenge ambition narratives.</li>
<li>Energy and resource supply security remain top-of-mind in geopolitics, with rare earth minerals, lithium, and multi-national supply agreements increasingly front-and-center with US and Asian partners.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials &amp; Real Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Housing is stabilizing, benefiting from lowered mortgage rates and early signs of supply/demand normalization, though upside is limited by still-elevated rates and affordability constraints.</li>
<li>With the debt burden rising, treasuries may face episodes of volatility; government shutdowns or rating watch actions could produce short-term shocks without triggering systemic events.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Labor</h3>
<ul>
<li>Policy headlines (e.g., halted NIH grants) introduce uncertainty around R&amp;D funding and public health spending, with particular risk to sectors dependent on federal appropriations.</li>
<li>Real wage gains are moderately expected to outpace inflation, but only marginally, suggesting consumer spending will remain positive but under pressure from higher living costs and employment softness.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Asset &amp; Theme Takeaways</h2>
<h3>Equities</h3>
<ul>
<li>S&amp;P 500 composition is expected to remain tech-heavy, with little expectation for the &quot;Magnificent 7&quot; to shrink significantly in index share. Macro stabilization and continued nominal growth support large caps but with headwinds from higher rates and narrow margins for error on inflation.</li>
<li>Consumer sentiment is showing mixed signals (e.g., pop culture and legal distractions have minor effect), but wage and employment trends point to a resilient, if slower, consumption environment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin and Ethereum maintain significant momentum: large upside targets for 2025 (e.g., BTC to $150k+, ETH to $5k+) are conceivable but not mainstream expectations; deep pullback scenarios remain low probability.</li>
<li>Regulatory, macro-stability, and risk-on sentiment continue as key drivers for crypto; a sustained risk-off or higher-for-longer rate backdrop could weigh but is not baseline.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global &amp; Geopolitical</h3>
<ul>
<li>Middle East tensions (Gaza, West Bank, Iran) remain a potential wild card for energy and risk assets.</li>
<li>US-China trade tensions are primed for renewed moves, especially in technology and resource sectors; semi and rare earths are especially vulnerable to policy shocks.</li>
<li>Europe faces gnawing health and climate-linked risks (vector-borne diseases, extreme weather), which could affect regional GDP, sectoral exposure, and long-duration real assets.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Summary View</h2>
<ul>
<li>The consensus for 2025: No imminent US or global recession, modest growth, persistent (but not runaway) inflation, gradual (not aggressive) monetary easing, and high but manageable fiscal deficits.</li>
<li>Tech and renewable energy continue to be growth spots but face policy and supply chain turbulence; equity markets remain supported by large-cap dominance.</li>
<li>Watch the next Fed signals, fiscal wrangling in DC, US-China trade policy, and signs of labor market fatigue for tactical positioning.</li>
<li>Shocks from geopolitics, climate, or policy standoffs can't be ruled out—but the probability-weighted path leans toward muddle-through, not regime shift.</li>
