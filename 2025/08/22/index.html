<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Market Overview</h2>
<h3>Economic Outlook</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soft Landing Still the Base Case:</strong> Probability consensus points to a soft landing for the US economy through 2025. The risk of US recession or stagflation remains subdued but not off the table.</li>
<li><strong>Growth and Inflation:</strong> GDP growth is likely to be modest (mostly in the 1–2.5% y/y range). Inflation for 2025 is expected to trend between 2.5–3.5%, with limited risk of severe spikes. Fed commentary and market expectations are aligning with a gradual, controlled disinflation process.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rates &amp; Fed Policy:</strong> A rate cut or two in 2025 is seen as probable, but aggressive cutting cycles or emergency stimulus appear unlikely absent a major downturn. Fed funds rates are most likely to remain in the mid-3% range into 2026. This points to a steady, moderate downward trajectory in yields and support for risk assets.</li>
<li><strong>US Debt Path:</strong> National debt will continue to rise and surpass $38T in 2025. Concerns over fiscal discipline and ongoing deficits persist, but a US rating downgrade this year is seen as relatively unlikely.</li>
<li><strong>Broad Market Indices:</strong> The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are expected to remain at elevated levels. Large downside or upside surprises are less probable, with the S&amp;P 500 anchored in the 6,300–6,700 range into late 2025, and Nasdaq-100 likely to remain north of 21,000.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Key Risks</h4>
<ul>
<li>Modest chance of a government shutdown in 2025.</li>
<li>Outflows of high-net-worth individuals from NYC could continue, potentially pressuring regional real estate and municipal finance.</li>
<li>Some lingering risk of severe natural disasters (earthquakes, hurricanes).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector and Thematic Views</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tech Layoff Acceleration:</strong> 2025 will see more tech sector layoffs than 2024. This puts pressure on wage growth and may weigh on consumer spending from high-earning cohort, but aids profit margins amid slower revenue growth.</li>
<li><strong>Semiconductor Resilience, but Supply Chain Risks:</strong> US semiconductor production is on track to grow strongly, but Nvidia’s China production halt highlights the ongoing fragility of global chip supply and persistent regulatory/political risk.</li>
<li><strong>AI &amp; IPO Pipeline:</strong> Look for OpenAI to be the first among major AI unicorns to pursue a public market listing, further cementing AI’s role as an investment theme. AI sector faces increasing regulatory risk; OpenAI is seen as likely to face meaningful legal claims soon.</li>
<li><strong>Platform Shifts:</strong> Leadership among mega-cap techs appears stable; however, Nvidia stands a strong chance of ending the year as the world’s largest company by market cap due to continued AI/semiconductor momentum, while Apple and Microsoft are less likely to regain the top spot for now.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials &amp; Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>ETF Inflows and Digital Assets:</strong> BlackRock will position its message on digital assets and fund flows positively; continued record highs in assets under management are setting a supportive backdrop for ETF providers and asset managers.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong> Expect resilience and upside for major tokens. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are forecast to maintain values at or above the lower end of their recent trading ranges—though outsized, rapid upward moves (e.g., $250K BTC or $10K ETH) are relatively low-probability for 2025. Regulatory clarity and the expanding ETF universe (XRP, DOGE approvals) could be important demand catalysts despite the long-term volatility.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Assets, Commodities, &amp; Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Housing Market:</strong> Modest but positive rent growth continues in SF and, more notably, in NYC. National real estate markets may be stabilizing after a soft patch—watch for a shift from cooling to warming conditions, which could underpin REITs and homebuilder performance.</li>
<li><strong>Energy &amp; Renewables:</strong> Robust growth in solar capacity installations is expected, keeping the theme of energy transition investable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Public Health</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ongoing Virus Threats:</strong> Outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease, resurgence of West Nile, and a new plague case highlight the need for monitoring healthcare and biosafety plays, but do not presently pose systemic risk.</li>
<li><strong>Covid Vaccine Distribution Woes:</strong> Logistical challenges continue, but without material economic effect at this time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics &amp; Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Domestic Policy:</strong> Budget discipline remains weak, and even with efforts to cut government spending, the primary trend is for higher deficits and spending. Changes to immigration policy and workforce restrictions could foster both sectoral labor shortages and political volatility.</li>
<li><strong>US-China &amp; Semiconductors:</strong> Heightened tensions introduce headline and supply chain volatility risk, especially for technology hardware sectors.</li>
<li><strong>US-Middle East &amp; Russia-Ukraine:</strong> Gaza crisis has escalated risk perceptions while Ukraine conflict continues to simmer without major new escalation indicators.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company-Specific Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia:</strong> Momentum in AI, robotics, and sovereign/enterprise cloud demand propel Nvidia’s standing—expect continued bullish commentary on datacenter and product line. China regulatory headwinds are a watch item.</li>
<li><strong>Oracle:</strong> Next earnings likely to emphasize cloud backlog and infrastructure momentum, with AI and multi-cloud collaborations also key talking points. No large surprises expected.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Regulatory and legal actions (tort claims) increasingly likely to mount; could affect timing/valuation of a potential IPO.</li>
<li><strong>Meta, Apple, Google:</strong> C-suite turnover risk remains low. Ongoing AI talent wars (notably Meta poaching from Apple) could have longer-term innovation and market share implications.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Actionable Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stay overweight quality US equities, especially tech and semiconductors, but be mindful of China regulatory exposure.</li>
<li>Reassess allocations to commercial real estate and related credit risk in markets with high outflows (NYC, SF), though national conditions are stabilizing.</li>
<li>Maintain some exposure to digital assets and crypto ETF vehicles. Consider risk-mitigation for highly speculative coins.</li>
<li>Monitor themes around US fiscal sustainability and upcoming Fed communications for tactical duration management in fixed income.</li>
<li>Watch for late-summer/early-fall clarity in policy direction and macro data, especially as election season rhetoric heats up.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Monitoring Triggers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Powell’s Jackson Hole speech for monetary policy signposts.</li>
<li>Evolution in US-China tech/trade headlines.</li>
<li>Tangible impacts from US immigration and government budget disputes.</li>
<li>Surprises in high-impact economic/activity data (payrolls, GDP, inflation).</li>
</ul>
