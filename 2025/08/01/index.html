<h1>Daily Memo (01-Aug-2025)</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Key News Summaries</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Tariff Blitz</strong>: The Trump administration enacted new tariff rounds on dozens of countries, effective August 7, with significant increases on Canadian imports. Trade partners are reacting, with some nations threatening retaliation and cost increases being felt in multiple economies. Tariffs impact electronics, autos, and consumer goods pricing directly.</li>
<li><strong>International Recognition of Palestinian State</strong>: The UK, France, and Canada announced plans to recognize a Palestinian state, drawing mixed reactions. Trump is leveraging Canada's decision in ongoing trade negotiations, further complicating trade relations.</li>
<li><strong>Apple Earnings Surprise</strong>: Apple reported robust iPhone sales, outperforming expectations, with particular strength attributed to its iPhone 16 line and steady growth in China. Tariff costs are estimated at $1.1 billion for the period.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market &amp; Tech Employment</strong>: Tech layoffs in 2025 surpass 2024 levels. Unemployment trends upward but remains under 4.4%. Significant labor cost pressures persist in tech and mobility sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Major Geopolitical Events</strong>: Russia launched a deadly missile/drone strike on Kyiv. Asian equity markets struggled following the US tariff shockwaves.</li>
<li><strong>Domestic Fiscal Policy</strong>: Reports cite further increases in US national debt, with strong odds of surpassing $38T by year-end. Government spending projected to increase by at least $500B this year. No signs indicate imminent US default, but risk of minor credit rating downgrades persists.</li>
<li><strong>Key Sector Moves</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Semiconductors</strong>: The US semiconductor sector exhibits strong 2025 production growth. Tariffs on semiconductors and copper likely incoming, targeting Asian supply chains.</li>
<li><strong>Real Estate</strong>: San Francisco rent prices rising, driven by constrained supply and tighter labor market.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macroeconomic and Policy Update</h2>
<h3>US Trade and Tariff Expansion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Major tariffs against imports from Canada, China, EU, Mexico, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan now in place or imminent.</li>
<li>Trade tension fallout: Immediate effects include increased input prices for US manufacturers, likely boosting domestic production in some sectors but raising inflationary pressure on consumer goods and autos.</li>
<li>Foreign exchange implications: Increased trade friction may weaken major international currencies relative to the USD in the short term, but retaliatory actions could introduce future volatility.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal and Monetary Outlook</h3>
<ul>
<li>US federal spending is set to jump significantly, with the national debt on track to surpass $38T by end of 2025.</li>
<li>Despite rapid debt growth and large spending bumps, the probability of a US debt default remains very low. However, further US credit rating downgrades—though not highly likely—cannot be ruled out, possibly exerting incremental upward pressure on Treasury yields.</li>
<li>The Federal Reserve is not expected to enact large emergency rate moves; rate policy is seen as steady with at most one or two minor cuts, so large moves in US rates seem unlikely for the remainder of the year.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Economic Growth and Labor Market</h3>
<ul>
<li>GDP growth for 2025 is expected to run below trend (circa 1-2%), dashing hopes of an economic boom. Unemployment is trending up, expected to stay below recessionary levels, but job creation is slowing.</li>
<li>The likelihood of an outright recession in 2025 is still perceived as low.</li>
<li>Core and headline inflation expectations remain anchored in the 2.6-4% range—well off previous peaks but still above the Fed's long-term target—pushing back against aggressive policy easing.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Outlook</h2>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI &amp; Semiconductors</strong>: Generative AI and enterprise cloud remain strong growth drivers. US semiconductor manufacturing surges (+7-10% y/y), but the sector faces probable tariffs on semiconductor imports, impacting supply chains and enterprise customers. Discussions from Nvidia, AMD, and Amazon earnings will likely focus on AI, new chip platforms (Blackwell, MI300X), and regulatory/trade friction.</li>
<li><strong>Labor &amp; Tech Employment</strong>: Ongoing tech layoffs and margin compression underway. Companies with exposure to labor-intensive segments in HR tech, mobility, and delivery may face rising costs and regulatory focus.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consumer and Mobility</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple</strong>: Outperformance on iPhone and China sales, but facing $1B+ headwinds from tariffs, likely leading to incremental pricing actions and/or margin compression.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon</strong>: Strength in Prime, AWS, and advertising offset by tariff pressures and labor cost volatility.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil</strong>: WTI oil prices display significant volatility, with credible scenarios for sharp declines below $65 and spikes above $85/barrel. Tariffs on copper and broad international friction point to further commodity dislocation.</li>
<li><strong>Renewables</strong>: While coal and oil remain dominant in global energy mix projections, US solar infrastructure growth remains positive, continuing gradual shift in mix.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Estate &amp; Housing</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>San Francisco rents</strong>: Expected to rise by more than 2% this year. Macro resilience in housing, especially in tech-centric markets, driven by continued demand and limited new construction.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Management</strong>: BlackRock set to highlight record assets under management and surging interest in digital assets.</li>
<li><strong>Banking</strong>: JP Morgan's succession planning enters a public phase, with modest leadership risk.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company/Asset-Specific Insights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong>: Robust sales growth continues; exposure to China remains a double-edged sword under new tariffs and regulatory uncertainties.</li>
<li><strong>Nvidia (NVDA)</strong>: Expansion in AI, datacenter, networking, and growing sovereign/robotic business lines. New export and tariff restrictions may affect forward guidance.</li>
<li><strong>AMD</strong>: Focus on MI300X, chiplet architecture, and automotive AI. Potential risk from new semiconductor tariff regime.</li>
<li><strong>BlackRock</strong>: Likely to emphasize strength in digital assets and record AUM; ETF inflows also supportive.</li>
<li><strong>MicroStrategy</strong>: Will continue to highlight leverage, Bitcoin holdings, and digital gold thesis.</li>
<li><strong>Bitcoin/Ethereum</strong>: Crypto market volatility persists. No near-term indication of astronomical upside moves, but medium-term tailwinds remain intact with stablecoins (USDC/USDT) growing.</li>
<li><strong>Uber</strong>: Faces regulatory headwinds, labor costs, and rising competition from autonomy and Waymo.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Second-Order Effects &amp; Themes to Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supply Chain Localization</strong>: Increased tariffs may shift production and sourcing to the US or friendlier nations, benefitting select industrials and chip manufacturers but raising costs.</li>
<li><strong>Global Macro Volatility</strong>: US trade actions risk spreading ripple effects into European and Asian markets, suppressing international equity valuations and altering cross-border investment flows.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation Pass-Through</strong>: With goods and input prices rising and labor costs sticky, 2025-2026 risks higher persistent inflation—keeping real yields under pressure and compressing multiples for rate-sensitive assets.</li>
<li><strong>Credit Ratings</strong>: While a US default remains unlikely, incremental downgrades could weigh on Treasury valuations and widen US risk premiums globally.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Risk</strong>: Escalating conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and increased uncertainty in Central America, add to the global risk premium and could disrupt commodity and defense sectors.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Actionable Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Defensive posture remains prudent: Favor quality domestic names with pricing power and resilient margins.</li>
<li>Remain alert to policy/tariff shifts: Market shocks around non-US developed and emerging market equities may present tactical entry/exit points.</li>
<li>Monitor real rates and credit markets: Seek opportunities in shorter-duration or TIPS if Treasury volatility rises.</li>
<li>Lean into US semiconductor and AI exposure cautiously: Near-term policy headwinds offset secular tailwinds.</li>
<li>Watch for signs of wage/price spiral and rising rent/housing costs in major metros.</li>
</ul>
