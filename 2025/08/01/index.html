</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Policy</h2>
<h3>US Macroeconomy &amp; Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>The US economy continues along a path of moderate growth, but with visible signs of deceleration: GDP for 2025 is most likely in the 1–2.5% range, unemployment is drifting towards the 4% mark, and labor market softness is expected in next month’s jobs data.</li>
<li>Inflation will likely remain sticky above desired levels (hovering around 3–4%), with only modest odds of a return to target ranges this year. Both core and headline measures suggest entrenched price pressures from tariffs, commodities, and wage dynamics.</li>
<li>Despite high debt and deficit spending—US national debt is set to eclipse $38 trillion by end of year—risk premium tolerances remain; sharp fiscal deterioration (&gt;140% of GDP) is not imminent, though ongoing outlays drive long-term rates risk.</li>
<li>Central bank policy appears stable; new Fed rate hikes are highly improbable, while meaningful cuts remain uncertain, with market pricing split over zero, one, or two cuts in 2025.</li>
<li>Recession risk is moderate-to-low in the near term, but not negligible, as persistent inflation and policy uncertainty keep probabilistic ceilings on index multiples.</li>
<li>Heightened baseline tariffs (10% minimum, with sharp country-specific hikes) threaten to drive input costs and stoke cross-border retaliation, which is becoming a policy headwind for global equities and consumer sectors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitical &amp; Trade Risks</h3>
<ul>
<li>The US-Canada trade relationship, previously stable, now faces material stress after Canada’s foreign policy shift and reciprocal tariff escalation. This may disrupt cross-border supply chains, especially autos, agricultural exports, and raw materials.</li>
<li>High likelihood of US tariffs against India, and additional new copper, semiconductor, and pharma tariffs forecast for key trading partners, with global knock-on impacts to commodity, tech, and healthcare supply chains.</li>
<li>Retaliatory risks from Europe and Asia may take months to play out but could cause sector-specific and global index volatility.</li>
<li>Middle East and Russia geo-events remain on the radar but are not acute disruptors at present (policy continuity is likely in Israel and Russia through year-end).</li>
<li>No imminent detonation or extraordinary global security risk, but tail risk remains for major geopolitical shocks.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors</h2>
<h3>Tech</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI &amp; Cloud Computing:</strong> Sector remains dominant; Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, and Apple will keep emphasizing AI integration, cloud growth, and new product verticals. However, several face mounting antitrust scrutiny—particularly for Apple, Amazon, and Live Nation, which could drive structural changes if legal momentum grows.</li>
<li><strong>Semiconductors:</strong> US policy is trending toward tighter export controls and higher tariffs, with high likelihood of relaxation of some GPU controls for friendly nations but renewed pressure on China supply chains. Further tariffs on semiconductors are probable, raising near-term input prices but potentially benefiting US manufacturers in the medial term.</li>
<li><strong>Mega-cap Positioning:</strong> Nvidia is emerging as the frontrunner to end the year as the world’s largest company by market cap, reinforcing the ongoing AI/compute capex cycle. Apple and Microsoft will likely remain top three but face regulatory drag. Amazon’s path is muddled by regulatory and margin pressure.</li>
<li><strong>IPOs &amp; Private Tech:</strong> Figma’s blockbuster debut signals significant risk-on appetite for software unicorns; pipeline for follow-on offerings may heat up.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy, Commodities &amp; Climate</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tariffs &amp; Commodities:</strong> Aggressive trade moves targeting base metals (notably copper) are highly probable, driving short-term price volatility higher and fragmenting global supply and demand dynamics. Energy consumption in 2030 is on track to remain dominated by traditional fuels (oil, gas, coal), as renewables struggle to outpace existing hydrocarbon demand at scale. Modern biofuels and nuclear fusion are unlikely to be disruptive forces in the medium term.</li>
<li><strong>Climate Risk:</strong> The likelihood of breaching the 2°C threshold before 2050 is high, cementing future regulatory, carbon pricing, and ESG risk. Recent extreme weather (Texas, NY, Greenland) may accelerate insurance pricing adjustments and infrastructure spending initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>Utilities &amp; ESG:</strong> Structural tailwinds continue for large-cap energy and insurance names tied to resilience builds, but ESG and climate investors must watch for tactical volatility driven by regulatory uncertainty.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin/Ethereum Outlook:</strong> Crypto volatility remains high with major assets expected to maintain upward momentum, but speculative blowoff tops are improbable. Bitcoin breaking $100–150k and Ethereum reaching $4–6k this year both appear reasonable mid-to-upper bound scenarios, supported by continued institutional inflows and new retail-friendly vehicles, such as likely approval of a Dogecoin ETF.</li>
<li><strong>Stablecoins:</strong> Systemic risk from major stablecoin depeggings is receding, although risk of regulatory action remains.</li>
<li><strong>ETF Flows:</strong> Heavy inflows into spot and derivatives-based crypto funds remain likely, especially with BlackRock and others emphasizing digital asset growth.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pharma Tariffs:</strong> New US tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals are increasingly likely and represent a potential margin headwind for global suppliers. This may drive supply chain reshoring and impact drug prices for US consumers, while creating short windows for US manufacturers to benefit.</li>
<li><strong>Broader Healthcare:</strong> Headline risks from diseases (Legionnaires', flesh-eating bacteria) and declining vaccination rates may elevate event-driven volatility in health insurance, hospital, and biotech names.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Media/Consumer/Entertainment</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tariffs:</strong> Higher baseline tariffs directly pressure costs for consumer electronics, apparel, and CPG, and risk pass-through inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Entertainment:</strong> Big tech (Apple, Amazon) will continue to push into content and live events (Prime Video, Formula 1, Thursday Night Football), but regulatory threats to Live Nation loom.</li>
<li><strong>Pop Culture:</strong> Drake’s entertainment dominance likely to boost revenue for associated media firms.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Industrials &amp; Aerospace</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Space Launches:</strong> High cadence of SpaceX launches underscores ongoing private investment and crowding out of old-guard aerospace.</li>
<li><strong>Defense:</strong> Ukraine ceasefire unlikely this year; defense spending outlook stable.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Names &amp; Catalysts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia (NVDA):</strong> Poised for continued growth across AI, datacenter, networking, and automotive, with next earnings likely to highlight further penetration into sovereign and enterprise verticals. Tariff and China risk linger but are offset by product momentum.</li>
<li><strong>Apple (AAPL):</strong> Earnings power remains robust, but regulatory and tariff scrutiny will be a constant drag. Watch for shifting supply chain patterns, product launches, and continued push on services, wearables, streaming, and AI.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon (AMZN):</strong> Murky guidance and increasing AI/cloud competition weigh on stock. High likelihood of continued margin scrutiny, regulatory/antitrust risk, and disruption from new tariffs.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft (MSFT):</strong> Focus on enterprise AI, Teams, monetization, and cloud; regulatory risk manageable for now.</li>
<li><strong>BlackRock (BLK):</strong> Record AUM and digital asset theme to drive investor interest, with continued ETF inflows.</li>
<li><strong>MicroStrategy (MSTR):</strong> Remains highly levered to bitcoin’s price action and narrative.</li>
<li><strong>Palantir (PLTR):</strong> Ongoing revenue growth, partnership expansion, and focus on government contracts and AI-driven solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Uber (UBER):</strong> Autonomous driving, regulatory interaction, and international market expansion are key earnings drivers.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Strategic Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tariff escalation is now a central market theme.</strong> Investors should brace for near-term input cost shocks, margin compression in consumer &amp; industrial names, and cross-border supply chain friction.</li>
<li><strong>US macro and policy are drifting toward stagflation-lite:</strong> sustained moderate growth with sticky inflation and policy indecision; rates likely to stay elevated; long-end yield curve sensitive to debt trajectory.</li>
<li><strong>AI and digital infrastructure winners remain resilient, but face regulatory drag.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Crypto’s institutionalization appears ongoing,</strong> with direct and spillover effects on liquidity and retail flows.</li>
<li><strong>Climate extremes &amp; regulatory forward momentum</strong> underscore medium-term thesis for infrastructure, insurance, and certain utilities.</li>
<li><strong>Rotation risk:</strong> Defensive sectors may outperform if inflation sticks or tariffs intensify, especially staples, health, and utilities.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Active Watchlist:</strong> Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, BlackRock, Palantir, Uber, MSTR, key ETF/sector themes (commodities, crypto, defense, infrastructure), and US yield curve (especially TIPS and long bonds).</p>
<p><strong>Black swan monitoring:</strong> Legal outcomes on tariffs and antitrust, unexpected major geo risks, and significant climate/weather disasters.</p>
