</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Rates</h2>
<h3>Growth &amp; Recession Outlook</h3>
<ul>
<li>Forward-looking consensus projects modest U.S. GDP growth for 2025—well below 3%—with the majority seeing economic activity between 1.1-2.5% growth. Fears of a near-term technical recession persist but lack conviction; a significant contraction is not widely expected before late 2026. IMF is not anticipated to call a global recession soon despite elevated risk chatter.</li>
<li>Unemployment is trending upward, likely in the 4.0%-4.2% range, reflecting softness in labor markets. Payroll growth appears lackluster, suggesting a cap on consumer demand and wage-driven inflation input.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inflation: Catching a Plateau</h3>
<ul>
<li>Core and headline inflation for 2025 are both expected to remain sticky above 3%, with little conviction for a rapid return to sub-2% levels.</li>
<li>Probability of a significant re-acceleration (&gt;5%) is low but not negligible; inflation above 3% is the base case.</li>
<li>Rent growth, particularly in NYC and SF, continues to outpace CPI, reinforcing pressure on core services inflation and suggesting continued support for real estate income vehicles.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal &amp; Fed</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Fed is highly likely to keep its policy rate above 3.5% into late 2025 and perhaps beyond—a shift from prior market hopes for rapid easing. No emergency rate cuts or hikes are expected absent a crisis.</li>
<li>U.S. fiscal deficits continue to swell. National debt levels will set new highs, surpassing $38 trillion, and government spending growth is robust, maintaining upward pressure on Treasury issuance.</li>
<li>Sustained high nominal rate environment should keep the long end of the curve under some pressure unless risk-off events materialize.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Themes</h2>
<h3>Technology/Semiconductors</h3>
<ul>
<li>U.S. semiconductor output is booming, with domestic production set for double-digit percentage gains this year. U.S. industrial policy and reshoring of supply chains signal strong near-term tailwinds for chip equipment makers, and related suppliers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Oil price forecasts are bifurcated: while WTI is unlikely to plunge dramatically lower, sustained moves above $85-$90 appear unlikely without a major geopolitical shock. Downside risk exists amid slower global growth.</li>
<li>The specter of new U.S. tariffs on copper before 2026 introduces considerable uncertainty for industrial metals. Should enforcement materialize, costs to global supply chains—and by extension U.S. inflation—could see an uptick, partially offset by weakening demand.</li>
<li>U.S. solar buildout exceeds prior projections but is still not reaching &quot;hypergrowth&quot;—renewables are scaling, yet incumbents in traditional utilities retain substantial market share for now.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Estate</h3>
<ul>
<li>Persistent rent increases in key urban centers indicate shelter inflation will remain a stubborn component of headline CPI. Positions exposed to residential real estate or REITs in core metros may reap continued rent-driven upside.</li>
<li>Risk pockets exist in overvalued regions or categories tied to discretionary retail, as evidenced by repeat bankruptcies at retail mainstays.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto/Alternative Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to attract speculative interest, with Bitcoin’s path toward $130,000–$150,000 by 2025 now seen as more likely, while much loftier targets remain improbable. Ethereum’s $4,000–$5,000+ trajectory looks attainable.</li>
<li>Stablecoin and crypto credit risk events remain background concerns, but widespread depegging or major insolvencies (such as Tether or Bybit) are not viewed as imminent.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare/Biotech</h3>
<ul>
<li>Policy uncertainty around vaccine recommendations tied to RFK’s political prospects keeps the sector on edge, but dramatic changes to public health stances are seen as unlikely this year.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Key Companies &amp; Single Name Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple ($AAPL):</strong> New $100bn U.S. investment announcement strongly positions the company for favorable federal treatment and expansion of its domestic footprint. Near-term outperformance versus tech peers likely, underscored by today's market action.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla ($TSLA), Alphabet ($GOOGL):</strong> Neither is expected to overtake Apple in market cap this year. Steady but not disruptive performance is anticipated.</li>
<li><strong>Take-Two (TTWO):</strong> GTA 6 release prospects remain positive, but not guaranteed. Any delay may impact TTWO share price notably.</li>
<li><strong>Retail:</strong> Repeat bankruptcy at Claire’s shows persistent strain. Retail real estate and mall exposure remain high risk.</li>
<li><strong>Defense/Aerospace:</strong> Shooting at Fort Stewart is a one-off but could boost debate on military spending or force readiness.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitics &amp; Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trade &amp; Tariffs:</strong> Trump’s aggressive tariff moves (India, Brazil, Russia)—bolstered by explicit linkages to energy imports—escalate trade tensions. Watch for impacts on consumer goods inflation, ags, industrial metals, and multinational supply chains. Secondary sanctions against Russia could induce further knock-on effects across global energy and ag commodities.</li>
<li><strong>Middle East:</strong> Israeli policy split over Gaza expansion raises risk of volatility in regional energy and defense markets; monitor for sudden spikes in risk premium.</li>
<li><strong>U.S. Political Backdrop:</strong> Uptick in domestic political maneuvering (redistricting, figures like Blackburn running for governor) hints at a more volatile U.S. policy environment, with implications for regulated sectors and spending priorities.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Second/Third Order Effects &amp; Watchlist</h2>
<ul>
<li>Prolonged higher rates will pressure low-grade corporate credit and levered bets on long-duration assets, while banks may see earnings headwinds due to flat net interest margins.</li>
<li>Sticky shelter inflation and demographic pressure could drive structural underperformance in consumer discretionary, while favoring holders of income-producing real estate.</li>
<li>Trade tensions may reinforce nearshoring trends, benefiting U.S.-based manufacturers and select Asian economies pivoting supply chains away from China/India.</li>
<li>Travel industry may face renewed headwinds from China’s viral outbreak, with ripple effects for airlines, energy demand, and global tourism flows, especially in Asia-Pacific.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br />
Stay vigilant for shifts in macro policy and inflation; maintain a cautious stance on long rates and overlevered assets. Trade and geopolitical risks are rising, particularly around tariffs and emerging markets. U.S. tech and industrial policy themes remain investable, with upside in domestic manufacturing and semiconductors. Watch for idiosyncratic events in retail, real estate, and crypto, and monitor public health/policy for outsize sector moves.</p>
