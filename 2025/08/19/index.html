<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Economic Outlook</h2>
<h3>Growth, Inflation &amp; Labor</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soft Landing Most Likely</strong>: Expectations remain for a soft economic landing in 2025, with unemployment inching up moderately but severe recession risk staying low.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation</strong>: Most likely for US CPI/inflation to remain above 3%, but the probability of a surge past 5% is low. Wage growth is likely to outpace inflation for many workers, supporting consumption but potentially denting margins in wage-sensitive sectors.</li>
<li><strong>GDP Growth</strong>: Moderate, in the 1-2% range looks most probable for 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market</strong>: Job creation moderating, unemployment expected to hover just above 4%. Tech sector layoffs are running above 2024 levels—watch for knock-on effects in high-growth metros.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fed &amp; Interest Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rate Cuts Incoming</strong>: High probability of at least one, possibly two, Fed rate cuts before year-end as headline inflation stabilizes. Rates are unlikely to increase further this year, with pressure to ease increasing as growth slows.</li>
<li><strong>Yield Curve/Debt</strong>: US national debt set to exceed $38 trillion by year-end. Ongoing large-scale government spending and deficits likely to sustain upward pressure on bond yields, especially long-dated treasuries.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Currency &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>De-Dollarization</strong>: Strong chance of a weaker dollar, with the USD Index likely to see new multi-year lows. This could ripple into stronger EM currencies and support for commodities.</li>
<li><strong>Oil</strong>: Volatility remains; WTI most likely to oscillate in the $60-$85 range, with weak global demand expectations offset by periodic supply constraints and possible new tariffs. OPEC cuts not assured, but possible if prices slide.</li>
<li><strong>Gold/Crypto</strong>: With macro crosswinds and policy uncertainty, tailwinds for gold and select cryptocurrencies remain. Ethereum is especially positioned for strong price action if ETF approvals accelerate.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Thematic Trends</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; Semiconductors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Tech Policy</strong>: Active government intervention set to continue, including tariff escalations (especially against Asia/China and now India) and direct government stakes—Intel specifically flagged for a large USG equity position.</li>
<li><strong>Semis</strong>: US semiconductor manufacturing is growing at a brisk pace, supported by industrial policy. However, sector faces complex crosscurrents: bullish for domestic producers, headwinds for firms reliant on global supply chains or Asia-centric revenues. New tariffs likely to shape supply chain decisions in the coming quarters.</li>
<li><strong>AI &amp; Data Center</strong>: Nvidia is expected to continue dominance in the AI/model hardware space and could become the world’s largest company by year-end. Active legal risks (copyright/antitrust, AI regulation) bear monitoring, especially for OpenAI and large platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Labour/Tech</strong>: Layoffs remain a headwind for consumer and enterprise demand in parts of the tech ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Renewables</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fossil Fuels</strong>: Despite climate goals and green policy discussions, oil and coal are still seen as principal global energy consumption sources through 2030. Uncertainty around OPEC and strategic reserves (SPR) could produce episodic price spikes, exacerbated by weather (e.g., hurricane risk).</li>
<li><strong>US Green Goals</strong>: Unlikely to be met, with softer progress on US solar rollouts and ongoing policy/political roadblocks.</li>
<li><strong>Commodities Watch</strong>: New tariffs on copper and other industrial inputs remain a high probability risk—impacts materials, EVs, and infrastructure buildout costs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pharma Litigation</strong>: Novo Nordisk and Hims litigation risk is elevated—expect ongoing IP battles across branded and telehealth pharmacy models.</li>
<li><strong>Public Health</strong>: Disease outbreaks (measles, Legionnaires') keep healthcare and biotech compliance risks in the spotlight.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials &amp; Asset Managers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>ETFs &amp; Digital Asset Growth</strong>: BlackRock, other asset managers to stress digital asset growth, private markets, and AUM expansion despite margin pressure from regulations. ETF inflows, especially for crypto, are noted tailwinds.</li>
<li><strong>Private Equity Deals</strong>: Companies like Soho House are going private—a potential harbinger for undervalued consumer names in a volatile market.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Country/Policy/Geopolitical Developments</h2>
<h3>US &amp; China/India/EU</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trade Policy</strong>: Tariffs are set to expand, especially on China, India, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Mexico, Canada, and the EU. Direct effects: margin pressure in import-reliant sectors, potential EM retaliation, and altered supply chains, especially semis and pharma.</li>
<li><strong>New Trade Deals</strong>: Probability of negotiating broad new FTAs with China is low, but deals with several partners (especially outside G7) may progress as US seeks to diversify trade partners.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Domestic Political Uncertainty</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Government Structure</strong>: Political instability (redistricting, possible government shutdown, partisan standoffs) raises risk of legislative gridlock and procedural crises.</li>
<li><strong>Trump Admin Direction</strong>: Emphasis on security, industrial policy, and electoral changes. Legal and administrative churn is possible but headline political risk (e.g. presidential removal, mass Cabinet firings) remains improbable in the near term.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company-Specific Insights</h2>
<h3>Large Cap Tech</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple</strong>: Low chance of CEO change; antitrust labeling as a monopoly is increasingly probable, with regulatory overhang possible.</li>
<li><strong>Alphabet</strong>: Similar monopoly risk; leadership looks stable for now.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon</strong>: Facing legal scrutiny for monopoly status; CEO risk low but ongoing regulatory tightrope.</li>
<li><strong>Nvidia</strong>: Expected to continue stellar performance—AI/data center growth, new product cycles (Blackwell), sovereign orders, and networking all flagged for near-term catalysts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tesla/Elon Musk</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delivery Growth</strong>: Tesla's vehicle volumes are expected to plateau or grow only modestly; ambitious affordable models looks less likely near term. Energy storage (batteries) is their growth lever.</li>
<li><strong>Leadership</strong>: Musk likely to remain CEO through at least 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Legal/Regulatory</strong>: Competition, FTC attention, and industrial risk persist; possible Berlin factory closure near 2025 is unlikely, but incremental risks from Europe rising.</li>
<li><strong>Longer-term</strong>: AI/robotics (Optimus timeline), semi truck production, and cheap EV launches are delayed or coming in below original guidance.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Others</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intel</strong>: US government substantial equity stake would shift competitive dynamics; likely to spur additional government-directed investment and possible crowding-out of private capital in US semis.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI</strong>: Legal/regulatory attention—copyright, media lawsuits—to intensify.</li>
<li><strong>Fintech</strong>: IPO momentum is weak except for Klarna (most likely near-term fintech IPO).</li>
<li><strong>Starlink/SpaceX</strong>: Near-term IPO remains unlikely, but sector remains vital as commercial space launches (especially by SpaceX) continue to climb.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Actionable Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Favor US self-sufficiency and “onshoring” themes</strong>—semiconductors, defense, and infrastructure—all likely to see policy tailwinds and capital allocation.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor labor/wage cost risks</strong> among consumer, service, and hospital/healthcare names as wage growth outpaces inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on companies with US/EU supply base</strong> over those with heavy China/Asia dependencies given high trade/tariff risk.</li>
<li><strong>Energy strategies</strong>: Maintain balance between “old economy” exposures (oil/coal) and long-term renewables as policy remains volatile and headline-driven.</li>
<li><strong>Be alert to legal/regulatory events</strong> for mega-cap tech (antitrust, copyright, and platform regulation can create both selloffs and opportunities).</li>
<li><strong>Watch currency outlooks</strong> for dollar weakness; may add tailwind to EM, select commodities and non-USD assets.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Near-term Risks</strong>: US/EU/Asia tariff/trade war escalation, spike in severe US weather, regulatory action against tech/retail giants, surprise government shutdown or procedural crisis, new outbreaks or supply disruptions.</p>
<p><strong>Near-term Opportunities</strong>: US onshoring, digital asset expansion, large cap AI/semiconductor winners, healthcare innovation, consumer cyclicals as wage growth outpaces inflation.</p>
