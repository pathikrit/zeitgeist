<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Broad Markets</h2>
<h3>Growth, Inflation, and Monetary Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. economy is likely to see <strong>modest, below-trend GDP growth</strong> in 2025, with the most expected range in the low single digits. A significant chance of recession before 2027, but a mild scenario is favored for 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Core and headline inflation are sticking above 3%,</strong> with limited probability for major deceleration—room for real rates to be constrained; inflation pressure is persistent but not runaway.</li>
<li><strong>Fed policy:</strong> Consensus expects the Fed will not raise rates this year; the market anticipates 1–3 cuts instead, implying cautious monetary easing. Emergency policy action is seen as unlikely without a major shock.</li>
<li><strong>US Debt</strong>: National debt is on course to exceed $38T by year's end, with little expectation of a lower deficit. Fiscal pressures continue to mount, heightening long-term Treasury and duration risk.</li>
<li><strong>S&amp;P 500 Outlook:</strong> Odds favor continuation of positive returns for 2025, but upside is moderating, with strong resistance above 7,000 and a broad distribution peaking in the 6,400–6,999 range. Market is not pricing in a crash, but second-order risks from valuation, macro, and sector rotation remain.</li>
<li><strong>Unemployment rates</strong> are not forecasted to spike sharply, but elevated unemployment risk may contribute to volatility if economic shocks emerge.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitical &amp; Policy Context</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ukraine conflict:</strong> While military escalation is constrained, complex negotiations and uncertainty around peace terms will affect defense, energy, and FX markets. Trump's approach continues to cloud Europe–US defense alignment.</li>
<li><strong>China–India thaw:</strong> Reduced risk of supply chain shocks in rare earths and semiconductors—positive for global tech/esg industries.</li>
<li><strong>U.S. policy shifts:</strong> Trump administration's focus on deregulation (e.g., EPA, IRS) and spending cuts remains more rhetoric than practice, but sector-specific risks exist for renewables and green industries.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Trends</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Big Tech faces significant regulatory headwinds:</strong> Courts are likely to classify Apple and Amazon as monopolies before 2030, which may force structural changes (e.g., App Store or retail practices). Exposure to ongoing litigation and regulation risk should be considered for both stocks and sector indices.</li>
<li><strong>Nvidia is set to remain the world’s largest market cap company by end-2025,</strong> reflecting dominance in AI and semis. Microsoft and Apple lead the next tier, but are less likely to overtake.</li>
<li><strong>AI race:</strong> Google is favored to command the top AI model by year-end, navigating competition from OpenAI, xAI, and Anthropic. AI copyright litigation is brewing and could reach the Supreme Court within a few years, impacting monetization models for the whole sector.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI is likely to face liability litigation ($1M+ tort),</strong> adding near-term legal overhang.</li>
<li><strong>Tech sector layoffs</strong> are expected to increase again in 2025, suggesting continued pressure on labor costs and margin discipline, especially for unprofitable growth names.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Renewables</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nuclear fusion remains a long-term theme:</strong> Breakthroughs unlikely before 2035; focus on incremental innovation in fission, grid, and renewables over immediate fusion exposure.</li>
<li><strong>Energy bills rising:</strong> U.S. policy rollbacks and tariff-driven disruptions are adding cost pressures to utilities and heavy industry.</li>
<li>Nothing imminent on major green stimulus; status quo or slow transition is baked in.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Public Health</h3>
<ul>
<li>High probability of <strong>measles case spikes</strong> in the US (1,400+ likely), raising baseline expectations for periodic disease outbreaks and associated volatility in health insurance and select pharma/biotech names.</li>
<li>No imminent major reforms on pharmaceutical competition/anti-trust expected.</li>
<li>Rescheduling of weed/tobacco is a toss-up—monitor for policy-driven surprises in consumer healthcare.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials &amp; Crypto</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Banking:</strong> JPMorgan CEO transition is approaching, with Marianne Lake and Troy Rohrbaugh as leading candidates. Limited immediate impact, but monitor for culture and strategy shifts.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong> Systemic risk from Tether and USDT depeg is seen as low this year. Major cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, etc.) expected to post positive returns, with ETF approvals continuing to broaden mainstream exposure.
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin and Ethereum are not anticipated to reach extreme highs, but could establish new cyclical peaks (Bitcoin $130k+, Ethereum $5k+ ballpark).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ETF and regulatory acceptance:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cardano, Dogecoin, and Ripple ETFs are progressing—further signs of institutionalization.</li>
<li>The idea of a US national Bitcoin reserve remains fringe, carry little risk for macro allocation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Names &amp; Events</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intel:</strong> Surges on government support, but heightened regulatory scrutiny as government seeks equity stake. Watch for government intervention risk and tie-ups between tech and industrial policy.</li>
<li><strong>Nvidia:</strong> Market leadership is entrenched—momentum remains, but upper-end valuation may moderate forward returns. Tech sector rotation is worth monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon/Apple:</strong> High odds of anti-monopoly rulings before 2030. Prepare for scenarios where these firms are forced to alter business practices—expect headline-driven volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla/Elon Musk:</strong> Legal outcomes in Delaware court and Mars project timeline hold longer-term option value, but nothing immediately decisive is priced in for 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Live Nation:</strong> Odds favor it being classified as a monopoly before 2030; material for event/entertainment sector structure and ticketing business models.</li>
<li><strong>Space/Aerospace:</strong> Blue Origin's New Glenn is likely to launch this year. SpaceX’s Mars ambitions remain highly ambitious and not base case before 2030.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Other Thematic Signals</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Climate &amp; Catastrophe:</strong> California and Japan are not highly likely to suffer catastrophic earthquakes in the near-term, but risk remains elevated enough for reinsurance and catastrophe bond markets to price in some tail risk.</li>
<li><strong>Populism &amp; Secession:</strong> Minimal likelihood of UK or California political earthquakes, but ongoing political risk supports cautious portfolio hedging.</li>
<li><strong>Sports &amp; Consumer:</strong> No direct market impact, but underscores ongoing consumer engagement with sports and streaming—watch for related ad and gaming trends.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Broad equities priced for cautious growth but not crisis:</strong> Defensive positioning remains prudent with lingering macro/sector tail risks.</li>
<li><strong>Tech’s legal and regulatory risks are accelerating</strong>—volatility likely even as AI and semis retain leadership.</li>
<li><strong>Energy inflation and policy instability</strong> are near-term concerns; favor underweighting high-regulation US green stocks and remaining selective in utilities.</li>
<li><strong>Watch government intervention and industrial policy</strong> in tech and semis, which can introduce both support and headline risk.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Actionable biases:</strong> Remain diversified, overweight quality in tech and defensives, and monitor regulatory shocks, especially in mega-cap tech and energy/industrial exposure. Hedging against energy volatility, legal action, and health sector interruptions remains relevant in the coming quarters.</p>
