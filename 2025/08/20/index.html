<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Policy</h2>
<h3>Federal Reserve / Monetary Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Markets see an overwhelmingly low probability of Fed rate hikes or emergency cuts in 2025. The base case remains for at least one rate cut, with two or more cuts also being considered plausible. Expectations are firmly for monetary easing, not tightening.</li>
<li>Inflation above 3% is seen as highly likely in 2025, though a run beyond 4% has notably lower support, and &gt;5% is viewed as tail risk.</li>
<li>Stagflation and recession risks are very low and negative GDP growth is not expected to materialize in the near term.</li>
<li>The probability of a government shutdown in 2025 is real and notable, reflecting fiscal gridlock concerns; however, US debt default is treated as a remote tail risk.</li>
<li><strong>Second-order impacts</strong>: Persistently above-target inflation could limit the magnitude of rate cuts, keep real yields pressured, and delay any broad-based bond rally. Public sector fiscal bottlenecks risk stalling some stimulus- or infrastructure-related sectors.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Global Geopolitics</h3>
<h4>US-Russia-Ukraine</h4>
<ul>
<li>No immediate resolution expected in the Russia-Ukraine conflict despite renewed diplomacy. Security guarantees talks indicate ongoing engagement, but no fresh US military deployments are anticipated.</li>
<li>Tensions around Ukraine remain a persistent macro variable, with limited direct spillover into US macro unless escalation occurs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Middle East</h4>
<ul>
<li>Israel's escalation in Gaza and call-up of reservists signals risk of broader conflict in the region. No breakthrough expected in Israel-Saudi normalization in 2025, suggesting continued oil market risk premium and volatile headlines for defense sectors.</li>
</ul>
<h4>East Asia/Europe</h4>
<ul>
<li>Limited market reaction expected from Korea or EU politics in the near term, but ongoing European defense and tech autonomy efforts may continue incrementally.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Highlights</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li>Competition for #1 AI model remains open, but no firm outcome expected from DeepSeek, Anthropic, Meta, Alibaba, or Nvidia within 2025. This suggests continued arms race spending, potentially benefiting AI infrastructure suppliers over short bursts from model leaders.</li>
<li>Apple and Google product news (Pixel 10/Android 16, potential M5 Mac line) sustain sector focus on device upgrade cycles; no immediate game-changing disruption signaled but consumers are watching innovation closely.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Retail &amp; Consumer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Target's shakeup points to persistent operational and demand-side headwinds in US retail, confirming margin pressure across mass-market consumer discretionary.</li>
<li>Pop Mart's soaring profits from the &quot;Labubu&quot; toy surge highlight appetite for quirky collectibles; watch for consumer sentiment signals in discretionary and entertainment segments.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin and Ethereum remain in upward price channels; substantial upside from current levels (e.g., $130,000 for BTC or $5,000 for ETH) is seen as likely by year-end 2025, but true &quot;moonshot&quot; targets remain remote. Major downside (retests of $50,000 or $20,000) is considered highly unlikely.</li>
<li>Approvals of Ripple and Doge ETFs are expected, which may stoke speculative flows and legitimacy for the next wave of altcoin products.</li>
<li>Second-order effects: More regulated altcoin exposure via ETFs could put pressure on asset managers to innovate and may lead to spillover into traditional financial products, but general financial stability not at risk.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Aerospace &amp; Defense / Space</h3>
<ul>
<li>SpaceX seen as highly likely to conduct a moderate number (4â€“6) of successful Starship launches in 2025, but extremely high cadence scenarios are not credible yet. Incremental advances rather than sudden breakthroughs in space launch economics for now.</li>
<li>Ongoing Middle East tension and US Space Force activities (e.g., X-37B launches) reinforce the sector's geopolitical relevance.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Insurance, Real Estate &amp; Weather</h3>
<ul>
<li>Atlantic hurricane season expected to remain highly active, with mid- to high-range storm counts and a non-negligible risk of a major (cat 5) landfall. Property and catastrophe insurers could face above-average claims risk, while real estate in coastal markets carries volatility.</li>
<li>Radioactive food recall at Walmart underscores need for vigilance in consumer safety segments; isolated event, but could spur scrutiny on food supply chain logistics.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li>Renewed vaccine controversy (with high-profile attacks on pediatric standards) and localized measles outbreaks underscore ongoing volatility in public health sentiment; no immediate sector-wide impact, but negative sentiment could impact specific healthcare providers or retail pharmacies.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Spotlight: Individual Names</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Target (TGT):</strong> CEO transition is a response to extended sales slump; signals ongoing challenges for big-box US retail. Risk of further guidance revisions.</li>
<li><strong>Apple, Google:</strong> Product launches keep secular growth narrative alive, but competitive landscape increasingly crowded. Apple silicon upgrade cadence remains a differentiator.</li>
<li><strong>Pop Mart:</strong> Monster quarterly surge on toy collectibility trend; not directly investible via US equities but worth monitoring as a proxy for shifting global consumer spending patterns.</li>
<li><strong>SpaceX (private):</strong> Starship momentum remains positive but not yet transformative for listed suppliers or broader launch service providers.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Tactical Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Duration exposure:</strong> Favorable backdrop for intermediate bond positions if the Fed begins cutting rates, but upward inflation pressure tempers enthusiasm for the long end.</li>
<li><strong>Equity stance:</strong> Base case supports constructive view on broad US equities, but defensive sector overweight is warranted given sticky inflation and government shutdown risk.</li>
<li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> Crypto assets may gain structural tailwinds from new ETF approvals and a constructive macro thesis, though tail risks on extreme upside or downside are low.</li>
<li><strong>Sector tilts:</strong> Defensive consumer and insurance face risk from both extreme weather and muted demand; tech/AI remains a long-term outperformer, but short-term leadership is still crowded.</li>
</ul>
