<li><strong>Climate/Disasters:</strong> Los Angeles wildfire death tolls believed significantly underreported.</li>
<li><strong>Security in AI:</strong> Major vulnerabilities discovered in enterprise AI assistants, including ChatGPT-related data exposure.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro Environment</h2>
<h3>Growth, Inflation &amp; Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Economic Growth:</strong> The market expects slow, steady GDP growth in 2025—most likely between 1–2.5%. A sharp acceleration or contraction appears unlikely.
<ul>
<li>Unemployment is expected to creep higher, with a consensus for levels modestly above 4%.</li>
<li>Labor market is softening but avoiding outright contraction; jobs growth is continuing but at a decelerating pace.</li>
<li>Core and headline inflation are expected to remain sticky in the 2.5–4% range, complicating Federal Reserve policy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Inflation &amp; Rates:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A return to near-zero interest rates or emergency rate cuts is not anticipated; additional rate hikes are highly unlikely as well.</li>
<li>Wage growth is expected to outpace inflation in 2025, sustaining consumer demand but potentially restraining margin expansion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Environment:</strong>
<ul>
<li>US debt will almost certainly crest above $38T by year-end, and the deficit will remain elevated.</li>
<li>Risks tied to ballooning federal debt could begin to factor more heavily into long-duration bond pricing and the USD outlook.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tariffs &amp; Global Trade:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Trump’s escalating tariffs target key partners (EU, India, Canada, China, more), while Mexico gains temporary reprieve.</li>
<li>These policies represent an inflationary supply shock with potential retaliation, sector rotation, and margin compression for import-dependent firms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Second/Third Order Effects</h3>
<ul>
<li>Expect renewed upward pressure on import costs (auto, electronics, industrials, retail/discretionary) and supply chain disruptions through 2025.</li>
<li>Long-term implications for USD strength: persistent trade tensions may slowly erode global demand for dollar assets.</li>
<li>Watch further escalation on the geopolitical front (Ukraine peace talks, China tensions) as a wildcard for currency moves, energy, and defense sectors.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Updates</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; Semiconductors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI:</strong>
<ul>
<li>AI sector momentum persists; OpenAI faces meaningful litigation risk over potential tort claims but remains expected IPO leader among AI titans.</li>
<li>Security exposures in enterprise AI (ChatGPT) illustrate real and growing risks for corporations and cloud providers—expect increasing spend in cyber and compliance tools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Semiconductors:</strong>
<ul>
<li>2025 manufacturing growth remains robust (&gt;7% expected). Tariffs present headwinds but have not derailed Asia/US sector momentum yet.</li>
<li>Watch for second-order impacts: delayed capex, inventory gluts if trade friction persists, or margin compression in consumer hardware.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>IPOs:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Public AI and tech unicorn IPOs remain limited near-term; OpenAI more likely to debut first among its peer group, but broader IPO window remains “only slightly ajar.”</li>
<li>Klarna stands out as the lone near-term fintech IPO of note.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Pharma</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drug Pricing &amp; Innovation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ozempic and insulin prices likely to trend lower due to policy and competition, but large “shock” price declines seem improbable in the near-term.</li>
<li>Several mid-cap pharma companies are expected to win FDA approvals this year, led by high probability for Sebetralstat, Donidalorsen, and Bumetanide nasal spray.</li>
<li>Lilly’s strength (GLP-1 segment) continues despite pill trial setbacks; sector leadership remains intact.</li>
<li>No near-term Type-1 diabetes “cure” breakthrough is anticipated; focus on incremental therapy improvements.</li>
<li>mRNA vaccine funding cuts may slow public health response and biotech innovation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Renewables &amp; Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solar Growth:</strong>
<ul>
<li>US solar installation continues, but upside surprises are unlikely; growth will remain healthy but below “surge” levels.</li>
<li>New tariffs may constrain some renewable infrastructure imports, especially for hardware supplied from tariffed regions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Energy Markets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Geopolitical tensions (Ukraine, Gaza, tariffs) add risk to global energy supply chains, keeping volatility elevated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Finance/Fintech</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fintech IPOs:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Klarna IPO is the sector’s most likely public event in the coming 18 months—others (Stripe, Ramp, Brex, Deel, Rippling) remain delayed.</li>
<li>Challenging IPO window constrains exit valuations and may prompt further rounds of sector consolidation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Macro Headwinds:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fed’s static policy stance and flattening growth outlook favor steady, defensive financial sector positioning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Expectations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin faces a realistic path to test $150k by end-2025, but probabilities fall off rapidly for extreme moves ($1M or even $250k).</li>
<li>Downside to $70k is still possible, but consensus is for continued, albeit volatile, upside through year-end.</li>
<li>Ethereum likewise faces resistance above $6,000; little expectation for $10k levels in 2025.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Second Order:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tariff/currency tensions and monetary policy uncertainty remain positive for crypto allocation as a hedge, but not at distress levels to force a breakout.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Names/Events to Monitor</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eli Lilly:</strong> Outperformance off GLP-1 sales; watch for spillover effects to peers (Novo Nordisk, etc.) and ongoing price compression pressures sector-wide.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Most likely to IPO of major AI firms, but faces increasing legal and security risk (potential million+ dollar litigation payouts).</li>
<li><strong>Klarna:</strong> Most likely large fintech IPO in the pipeline; outcome could reset valuation benchmarks for late-stage private fintechs.</li>
<li><strong>Apple:</strong> Secured partial win on tariff exclusions even as broader tech faces new cross-border headwinds. Ongoing supply chain adaptations required.</li>
<li><strong>Palantir:</strong> Public attention surging; regulatory/policy exposure grows as US/European AI, privacy, and cybersecurity risk management efforts accelerate.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Watch List: Risks &amp; Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Risks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Escalating trade wars, drawn-out Ukraine/Russia crisis, rising US debt levels, potential for DC political volatility.</li>
<li>Growing cyber/AI security vulnerabilities for enterprises.</li>
<li>Margin pressure from labor/inflation and tariffs especially for importers and consumer-facing sectors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Opportunities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Selective exposure to robust AI, semiconductor, and GLP-1/obesity drug segments.</li>
<li>Defensive posturing in US financials and long-duration bonds as upside growth surprises look increasingly improbable.</li>
<li>Tactically using gold/crypto as risk hedges rather than core allocation, given a moderate risk environment rather than crisis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The environment remains characterized by solid but slowing growth, sticky inflation, and renewed geopolitical trade stress. Stay nimble to sector shocks (tech, pharma, tariffs), defend downside risk (especially to importers and high-multiple stocks), and be selective on thematic growth names and emerging opportunities from IPO pipeline shifts. Watch for further rate/fiscal headlines and global-policy inflections for sudden market rotations.</p>
