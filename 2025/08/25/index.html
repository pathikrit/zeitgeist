<h2>Macro &amp; Market Overview</h2>
<h3>Economic Growth &amp; Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Recession Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The likelihood of a US or global recession this year remains modest, though risks mount into 2026. Soft landing is still the base case for the US, but signs of strain in Europe (notably UK, Germany, Japan) suggest uneven international performance.</li>
<li>Tech layoffs are trending up again, hinting at cooling in previously robust sectors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unemployment, Labor, &amp; Wages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>US unemployment is expected to rise moderately over the next few years, but large-scale spikes (i.e., above 10%) are seen as remote. Labor market softness is primarily felt in tech, while ADP and BLS numbers are under increased scrutiny for potential downward revisions.</li>
<li>Wage growth is still expected to outpace inflation for much of this year, supporting consumer demand, though the margin is narrowing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inflation &amp; Rates:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both headline and core inflation expected to trend in a 2.5-4% range through 2025, with little risk of re-acceleration or deflationary spiral. Real estate (especially rents in NY/SF) remains a hot inflationary pocket.</li>
<li>The Fed appears on track for a series of gradual rate cuts but will remain well above “emergency” monetary accommodation levels. No major surprises in Fed policy likely through year-end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Government Spending &amp; Debt:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Large increases in US government spending and debt are nearly certain; debt-to-GDP remains elevated. Fiscal discipline or major spending cuts are not on the horizon, further supporting risk of longer-term inflation and higher yields.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dollar &amp; Currency Markets:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Moderate probability for renewed bouts of dollar weakness—especially on “de-dollarization” concerns and as macro splits widen between the US and Europe/Asia. EM currencies like MXN under sustained downward pressure.</li>
<li>Euro may recover vs. dollar mid-term as recession risks in Europe stabilize.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sector &amp; Theme Hotspots</h3>
<h4>Energy and Commodities</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Oil and Gas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Volatility in WTI expected but with a bias toward lower prices by year-end, consistent with stable global supply and moderate demand. Gasoline prices are diverging regionally—Texas likely to see lower average prices than California.</li>
<li>Natural gas prices projected to trend higher, likely benefiting US gas producers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Green Transition:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most US solar buildout will come in below the aggressive targets, with meaningful (but unspectacular) incremental capacity this year.</li>
<li>Extreme weather events and heat waves could stress the grid and utilities, boosting the investment thesis for renewables and grid modernization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Technology &amp; Semiconductors</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tech Sector:</strong>
<ul>
<li>AI and data center investment remain prime growth drivers, with Nvidia expected to lead. Strong semiconductor production growth continues; onshoring trends and US government incentives have staying power.</li>
<li>Tech layoffs and valuation risks should not be ignored—momentum could falter if earnings disappoint.</li>
<li>OpenAI corporate structure could change, creating new public investment opportunities in AI adjacencies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Real Estate</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Urban Rents:</strong>
<ul>
<li>New York and San Francisco rents continue to climb, outpacing inflation and possibly pressuring affordability.</li>
<li>Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) with high exposure to these markets should see solid fundamentals, but further rate cuts are now slowing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Crypto, Alternatives, and Market Structure</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Market structure reform is likely—positive for institutional adoption but will increase regulatory pressure. Stablecoin risks remain but are not seen as system-threatening in the near term.</li>
<li>Corporate treasury adoption of Bitcoin expected to build gradually; Texas state-level crypto reserves signal incremental legitimacy.</li>
<li>Ethereum and Bitcoin both expected to see continued upside, with considerable volatility. Policy/taxation (eg. capital gains/tax exemptions) remain a risk but no major regime shift imminent this year.</li>
<li>Gold and Bitcoin expected to be competitive as “store of value” options depending on headline inflation or financial system stress.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Consumer &amp; Staples</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>M&amp;A &amp; Consumption:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Major deals (e.g., Keurig Dr Pepper’s JDE Peet’s buyout) signal ongoing international consolidation in food, beverage, and staples.</li>
<li>Continued high debt and government spending imply support for consumer demand and credit but also elevate systemic risks over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Healthcare</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pandemic and Public Health:</strong>
<ul>
<li>COVID policy uncertainty and public health scares (measles uptick) signal potential for short-term volatility in healthcare names (i.e., vaccine and test suppliers) and insurance providers if costs spike.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Companies &amp; Notable Names</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Poised to remain the world’s largest company by market cap; AI/data center tailwinds remain robust. Short-term correction risk if earnings or macro shock trigger rotation out of momentum tech.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Apple/Alphabet/Tesla:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Unlikely to reclaim dominance in market cap short-term. Apple product cycle continues, but upside catalyst is less clear.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Amazon:</strong>
<ul>
<li>CEO change risk remains very low; business as usual anticipated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Structural changes could create downstream equity and IPO opportunities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Second-Order &amp; Emerging Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Policy/Political:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Elevated risks of government shutdown, policy volatility, and (potentially) presidential impeachment proceedings inject uncertainty into the bond, healthcare, and defense sectors.</li>
<li>Social spending programs face curtailment threats (e.g., SNAP restrictions) with moderate odds; this would have downstream impacts on big-box retailers and healthcare providers focused on low-income consumers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Geopolitics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ukraine conflict remains a wild card for global energy and grain supply; peace prospects slightly improved but remain fragile.</li>
<li>Middle East/Gaza situation continues to draw sharp international attention—commodity and defense sector volatility possible on negative headlines.</li>
<li>North Korea risk remains low, but Asia geo-risk premium should not be ignored.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Actionable Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stay slightly overweight US equities, with attention to AI and infrastructure themes—but be ready for increased dispersion as tech/semis leadership becomes more crowded and cyclical.</li>
<li>Hedge currency and global allocations—moderate risk of dollar swings and international sell-offs, especially in EM.</li>
<li>Fixed income strategies should stay short/intermediate—major cuts or emergency easing are unlikely; stay adaptive to rate volatility.</li>
<li>Maintain exposure to alternatives (gold, crypto) as inflation, debt, and political uncertainty persist.</li>
<li>Consider selective real estate and utility exposure in regions with rent/growth tailwinds and grid upgrades.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Monitor:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Upcoming Fed communications, labor &amp; inflation prints.</li>
<li>Geopolitical flashpoints (Ukraine, Middle East).</li>
<li>Q3 earnings, especially in tech, staples, and REITs.</li>
<li>Policy signals from Washington as shutdown and tax reform debates heat up.</li>
</ul>
