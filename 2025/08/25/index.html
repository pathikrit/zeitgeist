<h2>Macro &amp; Policy</h2>
<h3>Economic Growth &amp; Recession Risk</h3>
<ul>
<li>US recession risk for 2025 remains fairly low, with base case of continued positive GDP growth, most likely clustered in the 1–2% range. Likelihood of an economic boom scenario is present but not overwhelming.</li>
<li>Unemployment is expected to stay elevated into 2026, with a visible risk of levels around or above 7–8% at some point before 2030—well above recent years, indicating a softer labor market.</li>
<li>Despite market strength, corporate bankruptcies are trending high, suggesting not all sectors are recovering, and mid/lower tier companies may face further stress (second order: tightening of credit, possible negative impact on commercial real estate and supplier payment cycles).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rates &amp; Inflation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Multiple indicators point to a moderate downward trajectory for the Fed funds rate in 2025–2026, but no aggressive easing: most likely scenario is 1–2 incremental cuts in 2025.</li>
<li>No significant probability of rate hikes or emergency action by the Fed in the next 12 months, supporting modest yield curve normalization and lower rate volatility, especially after mid-2026.</li>
<li>Core and headline inflation, while still above pre-pandemic levels, are not expected to spike into crisis territory (&gt;6%); base case has inflation stuck in the 2.5%–3.5% range, indicating persistent stickiness but no near-term reacceleration.</li>
<li>Real wage growth should remain slightly positive, preserving consumer spending, but not enough to drive a consumer boom.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal, Debt &amp; Shutdown Risk</h3>
<ul>
<li>US national debt is very likely to surpass $38 trillion by YE 2025 and will remain a major theme for long-duration Treasurys, TIPS, and risk premiums across financial assets.</li>
<li>Government spending will increase at least $500B in 2025, but probability for a $1T+ fiscal expansion is below consensus; expect incremental, not drastic, spending shifts.</li>
<li>Moderate risk of a government shutdown in late 2025 (high enough to disrupt near-term Treasury/agency bond markets and sentiment).</li>
<li>Outlook for further budget rescission actions is mixed, but divided government and political gridlock likely to contain the size of new spending or cuts.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Markets &amp; Sectors</h2>
<h3>Equities—Broad &amp; Sector</h3>
<ul>
<li>Concentration risk remains in place for US mega-cap tech (&quot;Magnificent 7&quot; composition is unlikely to break down this year).</li>
<li>Upcoming Nvidia earnings to serve as a bellwether for AI and tech market sentiment.</li>
<li>No credible regulatory threat to outright ban Congress from stock trading yet; no near-term structural change to policy-driven returns or market internals.</li>
<li>Defensive sectors (consumer staples, utilities) could face SNAP benefit cuts, but odds are mixed—impact may be more psychological (headline risk) than fundamental.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Estate</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rents are set to continue rising in San Francisco (modestly) and New York (significantly, &gt;5%) in 2025, despite weaker labor market; housing supply constraints and urban demand remain supportive.</li>
<li>Western US wildfires (notably Napa) highlight continued physical climate risks to real estate and insurance sectors (affecting both REITs and ag-related names).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy, Renewables &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Solar installations: Significant new supply (~40 GW+ feasible), but likely below market's most bullish forecasts; sector growth continues but may disappoint the highest expectations.</li>
<li>Clean hydrogen: Catalyst breakthrough news could lower costs and improve the long-term competitiveness of green hydrogen—watch for second order impacts in industrials and energy transition investments.</li>
<li>Middle East: Ongoing volatility (Israel-Yemen, Gaza) affects oil risk premium; no extraordinary escalation priced in, but headline risk remains for commodities and defense sectors.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Thematic &amp; Risk Factors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Supply chains in flux amid rising US-EU trade frictions and logistics issues—potential cost/pass-through for consumer goods and industrials.</li>
<li>Education: Test scores remain a concern; mixed to negative outlook in reading/math. Longer-term implications for workforce quality and competitiveness, but little near-term market impact.</li>
<li>Immigration policy is tightening, reducing labor supply in some low-wage sectors—risk to select ag, construction, hospitality, and possibly REIT names in high-immigrant markets.</li>
<li>Catastrophe &amp; Disaster Risk: Novel supernova observed and screwworm risk emerging, but immediate market impact limited outside select insurance and ag sectors.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company- &amp; Asset-Specific</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keurig Dr Pepper: Nearing major acquisition, furthering consolidation in the beverage space—look for follow-through in related consumer staples and food/beverage M&amp;A.</li>
<li>Nvidia: Imminent earnings will serve as a litmus test for AI-driven growth stories in tech; high volatility expected around results.</li>
<li>Watch Solaredge/ENPH for solar sector volatility if installation demand comes below best-case, but fundamentals are still positive.</li>
<li>No material US debt default probability for 2025, but Treasury/sovereign risk premiums may remain slightly elevated on political/fiscal headline risk.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Notable Watchpoints Ahead</h3>
<ul>
<li>Geopolitical flashpoints (Middle East, US-China/EU tariffs) remain ever-relevant for energy, defense, supply chain, and commodity names.</li>
<li>Labor market: Watch for revisions to jobs data and job opening numbers—second order impacts to consumption, housing, REITs, and retail.</li>
<li>Fed communications: Tilt is toward policy stability with gentle bias to easing from 2025 onwards, but persistent inflation could delay lower-rate scenarios.</li>
<li>Corporate bankruptcies ticking higher—be selective in lower-quality and levered equities/credit, particularly in cyclical industries.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Near-term outlook is stable for core US equities but with growing clouds at the macro and sectoral level—especially around labor markets, fiscal/debt themes, and policy-driven headline risk. Sectors to overweight: select real estate (urban multifamily, high-rent cities), clean energy/tech leaders (AI, hydrogen, solar at scale). Risks: credit, cyclical equities, commercial real estate, and small caps leaning on cheap debt or facing supply chain/logistics hurdles. Keep a close watch on Fed signaling, government fiscal debates, and geopolitical flare-ups as key catalysts.</p>
