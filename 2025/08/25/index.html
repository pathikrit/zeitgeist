<h1>Daily Memo (25-Aug-2025)</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Top News Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Israeli airstrikes in Gaza have killed journalists and medical staff, heightening Middle East risk.</li>

<li>U.S. government cancels $2.4B in Harvard research grants, escalating campus politics tensions.</li>
<li>U.S. government halts Orsted offshore wind project; Orsted shares plunge on regulatory/capex risks.</li>
<li>Keurig Dr Pepper announced $18B JDE Peet’s acquisition, indicating ongoing consolidation in food/beverage.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Policy</h2>
<h3>U.S. Federal Reserve and Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Fed is unlikely to hike rates in 2025, with minimal probability of an emergency rate cut or aggressive multi-cut cycles. A gradual path of 1–2 cuts remains plausible; rates may still be somewhat restrictive (&gt;3.5%) by late 2025.</li>
<li>Market consensus is for rates to decline slowly through 2026, remaining above 3.25% by late that year. The high-for-longer narrative has diminished, supporting risk assets and longer-duration treasuries.</li>
<li>Subtle dovish signals out of the Fed’s Jackson Hole stance, with markets focusing on cooling inflation and avoiding recession-level cuts.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Second-order effects:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Stable/declining rates ease financial conditions for corporates—likely supportive to large-cap equities, especially tech/growth.</li>
<li>High and rising government debt levels (above $38T by year-end) and more than $500B in new federal outlays expected in 2025 continue to pressure long-end rates, possibly leading to curve steepening.</li>
<li>Credit rating risk is slightly elevated but not likely (another downgrade would add volatility, especially in Treasuries and MBS).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal &amp; Political</h3>
<ul>
<li>Large U.S. deficit spending persists; a $1T+ expansion is possible but not baseline.</li>
<li>Trump administration expected to bring a hawkish trade stance: high probability of new tariffs on China, Mexico, Canada, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and parts of the EU; copper tariffs specifically are favored.</li>
<li>Pharma tariffs are now a coin flip, raising healthcare sector input cost risks.</li>
<li>Regulatory volatility remains, particularly in tax policy, crypto legislation, and university/government research funding (Harvard case as a flashpoint).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Second-order effects:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tariffs will increase input costs in manufacturing, autos, tech hardware, metals, and pharmaceuticals, potentially introducing margin headwinds and spurring near-term supply chain adjustments.</li>
<li>Tariffs could also boost U.S. domestic manufacturing (notably in semiconductors) and make select commodities (copper) more volatile.</li>
<li>Large fiscal deficits may keep inflation risk simmering in the background even if headline CPI trends lower.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Renewed Gaza conflict increases Middle East instability, creating a short-term risk premium for energy and defense stocks.</li>
<li>U.S.-EU tensions rise over campus speech/funding and Israel/Palestinian policy.</li>
<li>Low odds of eurozone expansion or abrupt changes in Eastern European governments.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Focus</h2>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tech sector will likely experience more layoffs in 2025 than in 2024, especially outside the AI/semiconductor &quot;hot spots.&quot;</li>
<li>U.S. semiconductor industry set for robust &gt;7% production growth in 2025, driven by ongoing CHIPS Act spending and public sector support (U.S. government is expected to take a direct stake in Intel).</li>
<li>Leadership at U.S. tech giants (Apple, Google, OpenAI) are stable.</li>
<li>Hardware innovation remains robust (Apple, Samsung, Google) but beware consumer demand headwinds outside flagship models.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Second-order effects:</h4>
<ul>
<li>AI and chips remain core growth engines; supplier ecosystem and capex beneficiaries (semicap equipment, industrial automation) stand to benefit further.</li>
<li>U.S. tariffs and industrial policy may spur further onshoring of technology components and modular supply chains; negative for select Asian and EU hardware firms.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li>Expect lower oil prices into year-end (WTI below $65 likely) due to global demand concerns and alternative supply, despite recent geopolitics. Gasoline prices in Texas have a nontrivial chance of topping $3.</li>
<li>Natural gas prices are poised for a strong rally ($4+ baseline expected for 2025).</li>
<li>Oil, copper, and other commodity-exposed sectors face risks from U.S. protectionism (tariffs) and rising alternative energy investment.</li>
<li>Solar energy installations in the U.S. are slowing relative to recent growth, but the 40–50 GWdc yearly range remains achievable.</li>
<li>Risks to offshore wind developers have escalated (e.g., Orsted), with U.S. federal intervention halting major projects—watch for ripple effects to other developers and suppliers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pharma sector could face input cost increases and trade friction if Trump tariffs are enacted; monitor global supply chains for essential APIs and devices.</li>
<li>U.S. focus on vaccine-preventable diseases (measles uptick) and pandemic-adjacent news (flesh-eating parasite) signal elevated regulatory/defensive interest in public health companies.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto</h3>
<ul>
<li>Major legislative reform on U.S. crypto market structure is possible this year; de minimis tax exemption and capital gains tax elimination seem unlikely.</li>
<li>Crypto remains fundamentally volatile but positive-skewed: Bitcoin over $100K this year is near-certain, with potential to test $130K–$150K by year-end. Ethereum could reach the $5–6K+ range.</li>
<li>Apple appears unlikely (but not impossible) to add USDC payments this year, so retail stablecoin adoption news not imminent.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Broad Markets</h2>
<ul>
<li>The S&amp;P 500 is expected to finish the year positive, with upward momentum toward the 6,700–6,800 zone by year-end and downside risk to 5,300, but a deep bear market or recession is not the base case.</li>
<li>Risk assets should benefit from a benign macro backdrop, modestly easier Fed, and strong tech/AI/semiconductor tailwinds, barring geopolitical shocks.</li>
<li>Sector rotation into industrials, U.S. manufacturing, and select commodities may accelerate under heightened tariffs.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Notable Individual Names</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intel:</strong> Significant U.S. government involvement incoming—expect increased investor scrutiny, possible de-risking of capex plans, and further support for onshoring of chip fabrication.</li>
<li><strong>Orsted:</strong> Regulatory/capex risk is escalating due to halted U.S. wind projects, with share prices under pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Keurig Dr Pepper, JDE Peet’s:</strong> Major consolidation wave in coffee/food sector; watch for antitrust or post-merger operational surprises.</li>
<li><strong>Apple:</strong> Leadership stable, new product innovation cycle (incl. foldables forthcoming) and steady movement into new form factors—core platform remains resilient.</li>
<li><strong>Semicap suppliers:</strong> Likely to benefit from continued U.S. onshoring and capacity expansion, especially as trade barriers rise.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Risk &amp; Opportunity Watchlist</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key Risks:</strong> Trade war escalation (tariffs, especially on metals and pharma), geopolitical blow-up in Middle East, regulatory surprises in crypto/tech, sharp cost increases for multinational supply chains.</li>
<li><strong>Key Opportunities:</strong> U.S. AI/semiconductors, domestic manufacturing, select industrial/defense equities, energy trading strategies (gas &gt; oil), long-term plays on federal infrastructure and tech/industrial policy themes.</li>
</ul>
