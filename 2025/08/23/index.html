<h2>Macro &amp; US Policy</h2>
<h3>Fed Policy and Interest Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li>Markets anticipate two rate cuts in 2025 as the baseline.
<ul>
<li>Rate hikes, emergency cuts, or a hold scenario are viewed as highly unlikely.</li>
<li>Inflation is expected to remain moderately above 3%, below 4%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Second-order impact:
<ul>
<li>Bond yields likely to drift somewhat lower with the cuts, while TIPS may underperform nominal Treasuries if inflation expectations continue to moderate.</li>
<li>The absence of drastic monetary moves suggests low near-term risk of policy shock or sudden market pivot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal, Tax &amp; Political Stability</h3>
<ul>
<li>Government shutdown risk remains a non-negligible tail event for 2025, though base case is continued funding after tense negotiations.</li>
<li>Corporate and top-bracket tax rates are unlikely to be cut in the near term, even under current administration. Little direct impact for broad equity indices from tax cuts, though incremental positives for high-tax sectors remain off the table.</li>
<li>Sanctions and executive actions (e.g., halting wind farm construction, partial government stakes in Intel) signal a more interventionist policy stance, potentially affecting capital allocation in energy and technology.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Labor &amp; Immigration</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mass deportations or major changes in immigration policy remain unlikely, implying steady states for U.S. labor supply. Sharp labor shortfalls or shocks do not feature as a market driver.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Focus</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nvidia is favored to overtake or retain the world’s largest market cap by year-end, reflecting strong confidence in AI-driven semiconductor cycles.</li>
<li>Alphabet’s AI momentum is boosted by integration prospects with Apple; Microsoft’s and Apple’s standing as top market cap leaders is diminished but not impossible.</li>
<li>AI regulation at the national level remains uncertain, with only a modest chance of an AI safety bill passing this year—regulatory headaches for big tech may be delayed but not removed, tempering sector-specific volatility.</li>
<li>Intellectual property disputes (Apple vs. Oppo) return spotlight to risks for hardware companies operating in or partnering with Chinese firms.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Alternative Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin’s upside is widely anticipated, with a base scenario for the year over $100K and a meaningful chance it clears $130K.
<ul>
<li>Downside tail risks (crashes to $50K or $20K) are minimal.</li>
<li>Ethereum expected to climb, plausibly surpassing $5,000.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>US is not expected to adopt national crypto reserves this year, keeping regulatory and monetary status quo; no pivotal legislative breakthroughs for crypto as a reserve.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Industrials, Aerospace &amp; Defense</h3>
<ul>
<li>SpaceX launch cadence remains very high, supporting a robust space/launch sector through at least 2025. Blue Origin’s operational hurdles affect only their timelines.</li>
<li>Basic US defense sector tail risk (e.g., NATO/EU boots on Ukrainian ground, military escalation with Russia/China) is seen as extremely low for the year. Steady demand for aerospace and defense remains the rule, absent major exogenous shocks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Biotech</h3>
<ul>
<li>Low risk of pandemic-level COVID disruption; new vaccine development could provide modest upside for biopharma, but tail risk of a new pandemic remains limited.</li>
<li>Health sector policy risk (e.g., abrupt termination of vaccine recommendations) is low; no meaningful regulatory catalyst expected.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Companies / Special Situations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia</strong>: Currently priced as the global tech leader; further AI breakthroughs or supply/demand surprises will affect trajectory most.</li>
<li><strong>Apple</strong>: Positive AI partnership news supports narrative, but IP risk in Asia continues to simmer; leadership as world’s largest company appears fairly unlikely short-term.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft/Alphabet</strong>: Alphabet’s AI-for-Apple deal is a near-term win; Microsoft’s upside as an AI leader is not out of play but lagging Nvidia/Alphabet.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla</strong>: Remains long-shot to reclaim tech megacap crown.</li>
<li><strong>Intel</strong>: US government acquiring a stake breaks tradition, may have implications for future tech sector “public-private partnership” models; usually not value-accretive for existing shareholders but signals strategic importance.</li>
<li><strong>SpaceX</strong>: High launch rate reinforces sector leadership; marginal ecosystem competitors (Blue Origin, etc.) are not closing the gap in cadence or maturity.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Tactical &amp; Thematic Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>US macro is steady: No sign of near-term recession or policy-driven market dislocation. Equities pricing in a soft but positive growth path, with limited bond market volatility.</li>
<li>AI/semiconductor leadership remains dominant; tech megacap crowding risk persists but is supported by strong fundamental tailwinds and low concentration risk for now.</li>
<li>Crypto remains in a high-upside regime, with downside structurally limited by sticky institutional demand and softening of regulatory overhang.</li>
<li>Political and fiscal events may cause periodic volatility (shutdown, policy intervention), but the risk of a systemic event seems low outside of exogenous geopolitical or health shocks.</li>
<li>Infrastructure and renewables face policy risk, especially as executive orders and interventions increase.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Balance toward quality large-cap tech, moderate allocation to crypto, watch for tactical opportunities in defense/aerospace, and continue monitoring fiscal policy maneuvers and Fed communications for inflection risk. Defensive positioning on Treasuries over TIPS if inflation expectations remain anchored. Remain alert to sudden policy or geopolitical surprise, but no immediate triggers on the horizon.</p>
