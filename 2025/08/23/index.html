<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Monetary Policy</h2>
<h3>U.S. Economic Outlook</h3>
<ul>
<li>The consensus scenario is for moderate growth: a U.S. recession in 2025 is seen as unlikely.</li>
<li>Stagflation and emergency macro events are not anticipated in the coming year.</li>
<li>Inflation is widely expected to stay above 3% in 2025, but surge above 4% or 5% is seen as improbable.</li>
<li>Policy expectation: At least one or possibly two Fed rate cuts are likely in 2025, with little chance of a rate hike.</li>
<li>U.S. national debt remains on a steep upward path, expected to surpass $38 trillion, keeping long-run pressure on Treasury yields.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Investment Implications</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Equities</strong>: Environment remains relatively constructive, but persistent inflation above 3% suggests value/cyclicals and companies with pricing power may continue to outperform. High-multiple growth stocks could feel headwinds if real yields stay sticky.</li>
<li><strong>Bonds/Rates</strong>: Short-to-intermediate duration fixed income likely benefits from approaching/recent rate cuts. TIPS and other inflation-linked securities retain value for hedging.</li>
<li><strong>USD/Currency</strong>: U.S. policy and persistent inflation could maintain USD strength versus major rivals (JPY, EUR, CNY), unless rate cuts happen faster than expected.</li>
<li><strong>Commodities</strong>: Inflation above target keeps commodities, especially precious metals, relatively supported.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>U.S. Policy &amp; Geopolitics</h2>
<h3>Fiscal &amp; Regulatory</h3>
<ul>
<li>Corporate or high-earner tax cuts are not anticipated in the near term, maintaining status quo for after-tax corporate earnings.</li>
<li>Tariff escalation risks: Trump signals new tariffs on furniture, suggesting renewed protectionism and possible supply chain/interior goods inflation.</li>
<li>No imminent debt default risk, but growing debt and rising fiscal risk could prompt volatility on fiscal headlines.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Political Volatility &amp; Federal Reserve</h3>
<ul>
<li>Heightened politicization at Fed (threats to fire Lisa Cook, possible new Chair nominees) raises risk of institutional instability but not yet threatening basic monetary operations.</li>
<li>Policy uncertainty could intermittently impact rate-sensitive and financial stocks.</li>
<li>Recent US government acquisition of Intel stake sets a precedent for national security-motivated intervention in strategic tech sectors.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>International Conflict &amp; Energy</h2>
<h3>Russia/Ukraine/Europe</h3>
<ul>
<li>Russian missile strikes against U.S.-linked assets in Ukraine and retaliatory pipeline attacks by Ukraine create a riskier climate for U.S. multinationals and defense/aerospace sectors.</li>
<li>Disruption of Russian energy flows to Hungary/Slovakia underlines Europe’s continued supply vulnerability.</li>
<li>Russia-Ukraine: Ongoing friction, with Russia possibly taking further territory (Lyman at play), yet no major moves toward ceasefire.
<ul>
<li><strong>Second Order</strong>: European energy and industrial firms remain exposed to supply shocks and price volatility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Middle East Tensions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Firing of U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency Chief follows contested Iran strike assessments; highlights unpredictable regional risk and intelligence priorities shift.</li>
<li>Israel-Gaza humanitarian crisis, UK recognition of Palestine, and low odds for Israel-Saudi normalization all suggest persistent and possibly escalating MENA instability.</li>
<li>Slightly elevated tail risk for oil/gold if Iran scenarios worsen, but no imminent outright conflict.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li>Intel deal and ongoing Apple-Google cooperation around Gemini AI hint at deepening U.S. tech-state integration and AI arms race.</li>
<li>AI leadership among U.S. giants (Meta, Nvidia) unlikely to be disrupted by new entrants this year.</li>
<li>No immediate breakthrough (&gt;90%) on new AI benchmarks expected, reducing near-term risk of new technological leapfrogs.</li>
<li>Increased federal stake/oversight in U.S. tech (as with Intel) has potential to reshape strategic planning and M&amp;A.</li>
<li>Apple and Google’s AI integration may preserve their leadership, but privacy debates (Meta, scanning controversy) are an active overhang for major platforms.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li>mRNA cancer vaccine developments could spark sector-wide revaluation, especially among companies holding deep mRNA tech or oncology portfolios.</li>
<li>Complicated COVID vaccine deployment and insurance challenges will affect providers and insurers—potential headwind for smooth healthcare operations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Climate, Insurance, and Infrastructure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Extreme climate records continue, elevating long-term risk for property insurance, reinsurance, utilities, and infrastructure operators.</li>
<li><strong>Third Order</strong>: Chronic heat risk raises the bar for adaptation investments and may increase claims for insurers, likely accelerating climate adaptation spending.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Companies in Focus</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intel</strong>: U.S. government stake could ensure market access, but also tether business strategy to political winds. Watch for defense/AI procurement opportunities and regulatory risks.</li>
<li><strong>Apple/Google/Alphabet</strong>: Alignment on AI (Gemini in Siri) may entrench their software ecosystems; material for both consumer hardware and AI software landscapes.</li>
<li><strong>Nvidia</strong>: Continued strong focus on upcoming earnings as sector bellwether; leadership in AI not under near-term threat but value rotation watch.</li>
<li><strong>Meta</strong>: New privacy/conduct (scanning device photo rolls) risks may rekindle regulatory scrutiny.</li>
<li><strong>OpenSea/NFT/crypto</strong>: New token launches and looming regulatory events (e.g., Bitcoin fork odds) suggest continued sector churn but no unifying market-moving events now.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Special Situations &amp; Tail Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Middle East Escalation</strong>: While a low probability, any sudden Iran crisis or further escalation in Gaza would turbocharge energy and gold markets, with global risk-off second order effects.</li>
<li><strong>U.S. Political Instability</strong>: While extreme scenarios (25th Amendment, mass deportations) are seen as very unlikely, growing administrative actions (e.g., Bolton FBI raids, Fed threats) highlight risk of policy shocks, especially for regulated sectors.</li>
<li><strong>AI Discontinuity</strong>: Major new model breakouts or security/safety concerns could move both tech valuations and regulatory timelines faster than current consensus.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Climate Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing record heat is nearly certain. The insurance, agriculture, and utility sectors will remain directly exposed, with adaptation and sectoral hedges increasingly important for risk management.</li>
</ul>
