<h2>Macro &amp; Rates</h2>
<h3>Fed/Interest Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li>The consensus expectation is for the Fed to <strong>cut rates at least once</strong> in 2025, with two cuts being the most likely scenario. Further, emergency cuts or rate hikes are considered highly unlikely.</li>
<li><strong>Recession risk for the US in 2025 remains low</strong>, but inflation above 3% is likely to persist.
<ul>
<li><strong>Implications:</strong> The central scenario is a soft landing, with modest easing by the Fed keeping real rates only somewhat restrictive. Inflation persistence (above 3%) may support sectors leveraged to nominal growth, but limit bond market rallies on the longer end.</li>
<li><strong>Second-order effects:</strong> Continued sticky inflation could limit duration outperformance and favor cyclical over defensive equities. Mortgage and commercial real estate vehicles could see relief as rates drift marginally lower, but no abrupt loosening.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inflation &amp; Fixed Income</h3>
<ul>
<li>After a hot wholesale inflation (PPI) print, expectations are for inflation to <strong>remain elevated, but not runaway</strong>—odds of CPI above 4% or 5% remain quite low.</li>
<li>The odds of US 10-year yield surging well above 4.6% are substantial, but less likely beyond that level.
<ul>
<li><strong>Implications:</strong> Range-bound or slightly elevated yields—little catalyst for dramatic rally in Treasuries, and inflation protection (e.g., TIPS) retains some appeal, but with muted expectations for a bond bull market.</li>
<li>Watch for persistent trade/tariff disruptions driving sector divergences and higher input costs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitics &amp; Policy</h2>
<h3>US Domestic</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Redistricting in California and Texas</strong> could affect Congressional control and, by extension, investor-friendly or -unfriendly legislation over the next 2-4 years.</li>
<li>Social Security and broader fiscal concerns stay in the spotlight, but US debt default remains extremely remote.</li>
<li>Immigration tension rising, with high-profile enforcement actions and new detention infrastructure in Florida.</li>
</ul>
<h3>International</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Russia-Ukraine negotiations</strong>: There is posturing toward a settlement, possibly involving shifts in US recognition of Crimea—while the probability is not high, even movement toward a deal would impact defense, energy, and select European exposures.</li>
<li><strong>Middle East</strong>: Israeli settlement expansion and the Gaza situation remain unresolved, with potential for escalation.</li>
<li>Gaza mass population relocation or regional disruption remains possible but not baseline.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors</h2>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia</strong> is expected to maintain its dominant market cap leadership, with other contenders (Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Tesla, Amazon) distant runners-up.</li>
<li>The Trump administration’s reported interest in a <strong>direct stake in Intel</strong> signals continued US prioritization of tech supply chain independence—watch for follow-through measures boosting domestic chip equipment and foundry investments.</li>
<li>Ongoing Big Tech resilience is propping up indices despite cyclical and consumer headwinds.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consumer/Trade</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tariffs are biting</strong>: Tapestry’s profit warning highlights consumer names with supply chain exposure as vulnerable if trade frictions persist or worsen.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon’s grocery push</strong> could drive margin pressure for rivals and alter competitive dynamics, particularly for logistics and food retail sectors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Alternative Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin’s trajectory is favorable</strong> through end-2025, with a mid-six-figure price plausible but not expected to reach bull-market extremes.</li>
<li>Ethereum appears poised for multi-year highs, with less risk of major dips; protocol upgrades for Bitcoin (OP_CTV/CAT) look unlikely as a catalyst.</li>
<li>Little near-term probability for disruptive crypto regulation or executive turnover at major crypto firms.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy/Resources</h3>
<ul>
<li>No outsized near-term catalysts (e.g., Saudi Aramco as largest global company).</li>
<li>Supply chain tension (trade, Middle East) and inflation could sustain a floor on fossil fuel and commodity prices.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Companies/Events</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia</strong> is likely to remain the world’s most valuable company for the rest of the year.</li>
<li><strong>Apple</strong>: CEO change remains low risk; no new foldable iPhone in 2025. Slight positive from resolution of Watch blood oxygen feature issue.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon</strong>: CEO transition risk almost nil; strength in grocery sales channel could drive new profit cycle.</li>
<li><strong>Intel</strong>: Significant policy tailwind possible if government investment is realized.</li>
<li><strong>Tapestry</strong>: Earnings and share price volatility likely to persist on tariff exposure.</li>
<li><strong>Coinbase</strong>: No short-term disruption at the executive level; regulatory headwinds muted unless crypto market volatility spikes.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Strategic Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk-on positioning in tech and crypto</strong> remains justified so long as Fed policy stays modestly accommodative and inflation does not accelerate sharply.</li>
<li><strong>Balanced duration exposure</strong>—do not overweight long bonds given sticky inflation; consider diversified inflation hedges.</li>
<li><strong>Be wary of consumer names exposed to tariffs or US-China supply disruptions.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical risk remains a wildcard</strong>, particularly for energy, defense, and certain European assets; monitor Russia-Ukraine signals and Middle East flashpoints.</li>
<li>Expect continued <strong>sector divergence</strong>, with winner-take-most trends amplified by policy and macro drivers.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Monitor:</strong> Ongoing Fed communication, next CPI/PPI, developments from the Alaska summit, and further details on US industrial/tech policy and consumer tariff actions. Respond quickly to shifts in geopolitical landscape, especially regarding Ukraine and the Middle East.</p>
