<hr />
<h2>Macro Overview</h2>
<h3>US Monetary Policy &amp; Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fed is expected to begin cutting rates this year, with at least 2 rate cuts looking likely by year-end. There remains very low risk of an emergency rate cut or hike, and extremely low chance for no movement.</li>
<li>By mid-2026, the policy rate is unlikely to be much above 3.25%. By end-2026, higher rates are extremely unlikely—reinforcing a lower-for-longer regime into the next cycle.</li>
<li>Inflation is expected to remain somewhat sticky in the 2.5–3.5% range for 2025, with core inflation trending slightly above CPI. A resurgence to &gt;4% or collapse below 2% appears unlikely this year.</li>
<li>US GDP growth is anticipated to moderate, majority view clustering in 1.1–2.5% for 2025 (below trend, but not recessionary). Odds of recession this year are low, though not negligible. Unemployment set to rise further, likely above 4%.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Strategically overweight duration and rate-sensitive assets as aggressive tightening risks are now remote and normalization is underway.</li>
<li>Inflation-protected strategies remain relevant, but upside inflation “shock” plays are now less urgent.</li>
<li>Macro remains moderately constructive for risk, but rule out “roaring 2021-style” growth.</li>
</ul>
<h3>US Debt/Fiscal Position</h3>
<ul>
<li>US debt to continue rising, with the national balance highly likely to exceed $38T by year-end, reinforcing secular deficit trends. No immediate risk of a US credit event, but probability of another rating downgrade has ticked somewhat higher.</li>
<li>Government shutdowns and brinksmanship risk remains; potential for intermittent volatility and sectoral impact (defense, contractors, public services).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Perspective</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tech earnings face caution as labor markets remain tight—expect tech layoffs in 2025 to outpace 2024.</li>
<li>US semiconductor production growth is strong (visible &gt;7% YoY), aided by policy, but with geopolitical overhang: risk of US-China chip detente re-emerging.</li>
<li>New US policy (Trump stance) signals willingness to “tax” AI chip sales to China, rather than outright ban—this could alter revenue/profit mix for Nvidia, AMD, and other AI-exposed firms, potentially supportive in the near term but uncertain over strategic horizon.</li>
<li>AI benchmarks &amp; regulatory risks remain a background threat; headline risks for OpenAI, Google (Alphabet), Amazon leadership changes are low.</li>
<li>Apple/iPhone 17 launch (higher price, thinner) and Google hardware expansions (Pixel Pen) continue to drive incremental hardware cycles, but margin pressure persists.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Near-term tailwind for select US chipmakers; positive for AI-infrastructure ecosystem if export strategies open to “regulated” China access.</li>
<li>Monitor risk of margin compression and cyclical tech employment resets.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy, Green, &amp; Industrials</h3>
<ul>
<li>Strong velocity of US solar installations in 2025 (exceeding 30 GW expected, with high confidence), but targets well above 50 GW look aspirational.</li>
<li>Ford’s aggressive EV pivot (cheaper trucks, streamlined production) aligns the sector for competitive price reductions—potential for margin compression.</li>
<li>Steel supply chains (US Steel explosion) under temporary stress; possible near-term price support in steel commodities, ripple risk for manufacturing delays/downstream users.</li>
<li>Little probability for new US nuclear reactor licenses, so no near-term catalyst for nuclear-heavy utilities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Green sector plays—especially solar—will do well, but “hyper-growth” scenarios such as massive 70 GW+ annual installations unlikely.</li>
<li>Industrial/materials equities could see episodic volatility from supply chain events/disasters.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Cannabis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Trump administration expected to clarify federal cannabis rescheduling policy soon, with a significant (though not certain) chance of rescheduling. This remains a material catalyst for the sector, supportive of cannabis equities and potentially hospitals (if descheduling eases banking/financing/friction).</li>
<li>New “off-the-shelf” cancer vaccine breakthroughs spotlight innovation premium in biotech, but no imminent “market-moving” approval.</li>
<li>mRNA vaccine funding controversies could impact pharma short-term, but second- and third-order effects (innovation slowdown, political risk premium) are for the longer-term watch list.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials &amp; Real Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li>No major risk events expected for major digital stablecoins (Tether/USDT). Crypto infrastructure grows, with new ETFs on track (Ripple, Doge).</li>
<li>Gold: Overwhelming odds of gold ending 2025 well above $2,500/oz; strong possibility of gold reaching/exceeding $3,200 as de-dollarization, deficit, and risk-hedge flows persist.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Equity Market Direction &amp; Notable Events</h2>
<ul>
<li>S&amp;P 500 is expected to post positive returns in 2025, with a substantial probability of ending the year within the 6,400–6,800 range. Downside tail risk (marketwide circuit breaker, crash below 5,000) is very low but not zero—correlates with government shutdown or geopolitical shock.</li>
<li>Tech megacaps remain outsized leaders (Magnificent 7 maintaining dominance likely).</li>
<li>Major volatility inflection points: Next CPI print, potential government shutdown, and “Alaska Summit” developments on Russia/Ukraine (contingent risk to defense/energy/agribusiness).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitics &amp; Global Risk</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ukraine-Russia “land swap” or peace negotiations carry real headline risk, especially for European equities, defense and energy stocks, and commodity pricing (grains, oil).</li>
<li>China-Philippines tensions, South China Sea incidents: raised geopolitical temperature, but threshold for acute crisis remains below actionable investment probability.</li>
<li>Government change in Australia/Pacific alliance postures and increased recognition of Palestinian statehood point to shifting diplomatic and economic relations within Indo-Pacific trade alliances.</li>
<li>US relations with China could marginally thaw if chip sales policy shifts from hard ban to “profit share” regime.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Crypto</h2>
<ul>
<li>All-time highs in Ethereum are favored before 2026, with strong potential for upward price action this year; Bitcoin likely to test $130K by year-end, but hyperbullish scenarios ($250K, $1M) are remote.</li>
<li>“Crypto as reserve” proposals for Bitcoin remain unlikely on a US national level, but new ETFs (Ripple, DOGE) are expected to proceed; ETF approvals may further buoy sectoral interest.</li>
<li>No material risk of Tether breaking its peg or defaulting.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Single Name &amp; Company-Specific Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia/AMD</strong>: Policy news around selling chips to China may lift earnings outlook.</li>
<li><strong>Apple</strong>: iPhone 17 announcement likely to sustain brand/pricing power; little risk from CEO change.</li>
<li><strong>Ford</strong>: New EV strategy and price point puts competitive pressure on rivals, but also narrows profitability window.</li>
<li><strong>US Steel</strong>: Explosion fallout may weigh on short-term performance and cause ripple inefficiencies downstream.</li>
<li><strong>Paramount/Skydance</strong>: UFC rights deal marks a fundamental shift in media sports streaming; monitor for positive knock-on in content libraries and recurring revenues.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Risks &amp; Wildcards</h2>
<ul>
<li>Government shutdown or another US credit rating downgrade could act as catalysts for market correction, especially in rate-sensitive, defense, and public contractor spaces.</li>
<li>Any escalation in South China Sea or effective “land-for-peace” summit deal in Ukraine would have broad commodity and defense sector impacts.</li>
<li>Above-normal risk for flooding, hurricanes, and catastrophe-driven insurance events for 2025; excess losses could add volatility to property insurance and CAT bond markets.</li>
</ul>
