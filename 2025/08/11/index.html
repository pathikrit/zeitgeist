<h2>Macro &amp; Rates</h2>
<h3>US Economic Outlook</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recession risks remain low</strong> for 2025, with consensus pointing toward moderate GDP growth and resilience in employment.</li>
<li><strong>Federal Reserve Policy:</strong> Markets assign a high likelihood to at least one or two rate cuts this year, but little expectation for hikes or emergency interventions. The path forward looks gradual and dependent on data, implying support for risk assets but less fuel for significant multiple expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation</strong> is expected to hover slightly above target, with a moderate chance it exceeds 3%, but little expectation of runaway inflation (&gt;4%). This scenario supports a cautiously pro-cyclical stance while maintaining vigilance for upside price surprises, especially in commodities.</li>
</ul>
<h3>US Treasury Market</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>10-year Treasury yields</strong> are likely to remain in a range, with a moderate chance they approach or slightly exceed 4.6% at some point in 2025. Markets see little threat of a spike toward 5%, supporting relative attractiveness of moderate-duration bonds and keeping a cap on borrowing costs for corporates and consumers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>US Debt &amp; Fiscal</h3>
<ul>
<li>The US national debt is nearly certain to surpass $38 trillion, reflecting ongoing fiscal expansion and pointing to eventual, but not immediate, upward pressure on rates and inflation expectations.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Thematic</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; Semiconductors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI/Chip Export Tensions:</strong> Nvidia and AMD face a new export fee of 15% on China AI chip sales, which marginally compresses margins and raises questions about future supply chain exposure. US government policy is doubling down on restricting strategic tech exports, likely incentivizing both firms and the sector at large to seek diversification and localize production and R&amp;D, creating both cost headwinds and strategic differentiation opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Apple:</strong> Significant efforts to advance on-device AI could usher in product refresh cycles and new capabilities, but no expectation of disruptive new hardware like a foldable iPhone in the near term, slightly lowering near-term innovation premium.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin:</strong> High confidence that Bitcoin remains elevated (~$130k+), but little market conviction it will reach extreme targets ($250k+). Limited downside conviction as well. Signals continued institutionalization and mainstream acceptance, but with expectations of less speculative blow-off top behavior versus previous cycles.</li>
<li><strong>Ethereum:</strong> Market divided on upside ($6,000 is plausible but not consensus), suggesting more measured upside in most major crypto assets.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate Holdings:</strong> Unlikely that MicroStrategy will begin liquidating Bitcoin, reinforcing narrative of long-term balance sheet commitment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gold:</strong> Strong likelihood it will close 2025 near or above $3,200, driven by macro hedging, fiscal expansion, and elevated geopolitical stresses. Momentum chasing in gold remains supported, though sharp moves above $4,000 are not viewed as probable.</li>
<li><strong>Lithium:</strong> Operational halts in China are sending lithium prices higher, with downstream effects on global battery supply, EVs, and energy transition initiatives; expect positive sentiment/performance for Western lithium miners and negative for battery makers over-exposed to Chinese supply.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials &amp; Retirement</h3>
<ul>
<li>US policy shift to allow crypto and private assets in 401(k)s invites both growth opportunities for alternative asset managers and elevated risk/fee structures for average savers. Regulatory scrutiny and potential volatility in retail retirement accounts are probable medium-term themes.</li>
<li>Growing participation in private markets may support AUM growth for alternatives managers, but could increase regulatory risk and long-tail volatility for exposed platforms.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Public Health</h3>
<ul>
<li>US vaccine R&amp;D under stress following funding cuts and public incidents; rising risk of lower pipeline productivity for next-generation vaccines.</li>
<li>International outbreaks (Italy, China) demonstrate continued headline risk for food/agriculture and supply chains; health-insurance and ag-focused investments should incorporate outbreak risk and response as core components.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Environment</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Climate/Disaster:</strong> Recent US flash floods and wildfires (including Europe) point to ongoing underwriting risk for insurers, and may accelerate regulation, premium increases, and capital requirements for property/casualty lines.</li>
<li><strong>Catastrophe Bonds:</strong> Continued climate volatility supports robust demand for reinsurance vehicles and TIPS as diversifiers.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Country/Region Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>US/China Relations:</strong> Tariff tensions remain top-of-mind; next steps could impact US industrial, consumer electronics, and technology supply chains. Watch for late-summer deadlines.</li>
<li><strong>Argentina:</strong> Likelihood that LLA (Libertarian party) wins the Chamber, but will not hold an outright majority, signaling ongoing policy uncertainty and volatility for Argentine assets and emerging markets.</li>
<li><strong>Middle East:</strong> Escalating Gaza operations and new global recognition of Palestine point to persistently high Mideast risk premia.</li>
<li><strong>Europe:</strong> Anxiety over exclusion from US-Russia talks; Ukraine situation remains fragile, limiting broader regional upside.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Notable Individual Names</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tesla:</strong> High probability Elon Musk remains CEO in 2025, limiting near-term leadership risk; expect continued focus on core business and diversification into AI/energy.</li>
<li><strong>MicroStrategy:</strong> No anticipated balance sheet Bitcoin sales; reinforces commitment to crypto-centric holding model.</li>
<li><strong>Nvidia &amp; AMD:</strong> New chip export fee is a modest but visible headwind; watch for responses around R&amp;D and non-China customer expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Apple:</strong> No major new iPhone hardware format expected; focus likely to stay on software/AI enhancements.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Maintain balanced US equity exposure; short-term rate risk is moderate, recession risk remains low, and inflation pressures are controlled but non-negligible.</li>
<li>Standout sector themes are gold and lithium (favor upstream suppliers), AI/semiconductors (watch policy-driven margin compressions), and private markets (selectivity crucial as 401(k) changes phase in).</li>
<li>Persistent geopolitical risk and climate-linked disruption bolster the case for commodities, catastrophe insurance exposures, and defense-related sectors.</li>
<li>Be vigilant on macro data and regulatory policy shifts, especially in technology, retirement savings, and international relations spheres.</li>
