<h2>Macro View</h2>
<h3>U.S. Economic Trajectory</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interest Rates &amp; Fed Policy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. is unlikely to see a rate hike or an emergency rate cut this year, signaling a “steady as she goes” approach from the Fed. The broader direction is for rates to hold or decline slightly, reflecting controlled but persistent inflation pressures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Inflation &amp; Policy Risks:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Inflation is most likely to persist modestly above 3%, with risks to the upside due to trade frictions—particularly new tariffs on consumer goods and autos.</li>
<li>Fiscal discipline remains absent; the national debt is set to rise without material deficit reduction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Recession Risk:</strong>
<ul>
<li>A downturn appears improbable this year; most sectors are holding up. However, risks from policy mistakes (excess tariffs, debt ceiling confrontations) remain latent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>U.S. Trade and International Position</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tariffs:</strong>
<ul>
<li>New tariffs predominantly fall on U.S. businesses and consumers, raising cost-push inflation. Markets are increasingly discounting immediate sharp shocks but remain wary of “tariff spiral” risk, given high-level posturing against China and global supply chains.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Debt Ratings:</strong>
<ul>
<li>While U.S. default is highly unlikely, the probability of another sovereign credit downgrade is non-negligible, which would push up borrowing costs and pressure tech and rate-sensitive equities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Impacts</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI and Semiconductors:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The requirement for Nvidia and AMD to remit 15% of China AI chip sales to the U.S. government caps some upside for these firms, introduces further cross-border supply chain risk, and could spur Chinese retrenchment. Watch for volatility linked to tech geopolitics.</li>
<li>Google and Apple’s ongoing product and platform updates (AI-powered finance, cheaper MacBooks) underline the dynamism in consumer tech, but basic product cycles (e.g., Apple’s foldables) remain slow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Broader Tech Market:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Low likelihood of major CEO changes at Google, Amazon, or OpenAI reduces governance risk among leading platforms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mainstreaming:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Expect a wave of ETF approvals for major cryptos outside the “memecoin” fringe (Ripple, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Cardano).</li>
<li>Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are on track for significant gains by year-end, with strong odds for new all-time highs, barring severe systemic events—continued ETF adoption and regulatory accommodation are likely catalysts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Systemic Risk:</strong>
<ul>
<li>No imminent threat of Tether (USDT) insolvency or depeg in the near term. However, always monitor for liquidity events on major stablecoins.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory/Fraud:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Various legal and governance issues (e.g., crypto influencers, exchange activity) highlight background risk but do not indicate broad systemic disruption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy, Commodities &amp; Industrials</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy Markets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The probability of a major disruption (e.g., Straits of Hormuz closure) remains low, but ongoing Middle East volatility and Gulf geopolitics could support crude and LNG prices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>EVs &amp; Autos:</strong>
<ul>
<li>U.S. automakers signal preference shift to trucks/SUVs as EV policies change, presenting risks to EV suppliers and upside for conventional auto/commodity players. New tariffs create potential headwinds for imported components and vehicles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cannabis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Rescheduling remains possible but not guaranteed; avoid overcommitting to cannabis equities near term.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials &amp; Bonds</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rates Outlook:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Expectations are for the 10-year Treasury yield to float near or below the 4% level, with moderate likelihood of limited downside toward 3.5%. Upside yield shocks above 4.8% look limited unless inflation sharply overshoots.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sovereign Debt:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Persistent budget deficits and headline debt levels pose long-term risks. Treasury market volatility may be higher if another downgrade occurs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Assets, REITs, Insurance</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical Risk:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Increased extreme weather and anticipated hurricanes should be a risk consideration for insurers, utilities, and real asset operators.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>REITs:</strong>
<ul>
<li>With rates anchored and no imminent emergency cuts, real estate yield spreads should remain stable, but watch for property-specific and climate impacts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company-Specific &amp; Micro Themes</h2>
<h3>Notables</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia &amp; AMD:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Geopolitics creates margin pressure but demand for AI hardware remains robust.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Apple:</strong>
<ul>
<li>No expectation for dramatic new product launches or foldable devices—incremental innovation and value pricing are the focus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Google:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Stable management; ongoing product innovation. Upcoming AI-powered Finance is a watch area for disruption in financial data services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Corporate structure in flux, though no immediate high-level changes expected; keep watching for M&amp;A or governance shake-up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>M&amp;A, Litigation, Leadership</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Little sign of near-term high-impact leadership departures at major tech names.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Minimal M&amp;A event-driven risk; Klarna’s IPO is one bright spot as fintech listings return.</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Watchlist/Actionables</h2>
<ul>
<li>Underweight companies highly exposed to imported goods costs, especially retailers and auto makers, given that tariffs will likely compress margins.</li>
<li>Remain vigilant for signs of supply-chain retaliation from China/EU as U.S. increases tariff pressure.</li>
<li>Consider favoring U.S.-centric, rate-sensitive sectors as long as rate movements remain muted; reevaluate if inflation pressures resurface due to tariffs or budget stress.</li>
<li>Monitor insurance/assets exposed to U.S. Gulf/Atlantic for climate- and weather-driven dislocation.</li>
<li>Stay alert to sudden escalations in Middle East or Ukraine but base case is for volatility, not global contagion.</li>
<li>Crypto: Strong tailwind for major coins as ETF adoption continues, but maintain discipline and hedge on large, crowded consensus trades. Systemic stablecoin risk is low but remain watchful.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
<p>Markets are pricing for continued economic resilience in the U.S. and ongoing innovation from major tech and crypto platforms, but upside inflation and supply chain risks—especially from fresh tariffs—could destabilize expectations quickly. Major geopolitical events remain in the “tail risk” category, yet headline-driven volatility should be expected. Stay nimble, focus on cost-management leaders, and don't overreact to the low baseline probabilities of market-crashing events.</p>
