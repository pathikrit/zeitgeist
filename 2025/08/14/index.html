<h2>Macro Overview</h2>
<h3>US Monetary Policy &amp; Economy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fed Outlook:</strong> A strong rate cut bias persists for 2025, with market consensus expecting a cut this year. Rates are not expected to rise again in the near to medium term. Yields on the 10-year Treasury may get close to, but not substantially above, 4.6%. Emergency rate cuts or hikes are very unlikely, signaling policymakers see no urgent crisis or overheating.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation and Growth:</strong> Inflation is expected to remain sticky above 3%, with little expectation for an aggressive surge beyond 4%. Core and headline inflation maintain a &quot;higher-for-longer&quot; profile, supporting limited Fed action. Real wage growth is likely, as nominal wage increases may stay marginally ahead of price rises. US economic growth is expected to moderate: very strong (3%+) GDP growth is unlikely; consensus leans toward 1–2.5% for 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market:</strong> The jobs market is cooling. High unemployment is not expected, but growth in jobs is set to slow, with below-trend monthly prints. Unemployment may edge above 4%.</li>
</ul>
<h3>US Fiscal Situation</h3>
<ul>
<li>US debt is set to rise steadily, breaching $38 trillion and pushing near 130% of GDP in 2025. While a debt default is extremely unlikely, fiscal expansion and persistent deficits remain risks for future inflation and currency stability.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Markets &amp; Sectors</h2>
<h3>Equities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>S&amp;P 500:</strong> Indices are poised for continued strength, with high probability of the index exceeding 6,500 this year; there is little risk of a broad market circuit breaker or crash in the near term. S&amp;P index composition may see Carvana added this year, but no consensus on other specific names.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer:</strong> Restaurant and retail chains are demonstrating signs of consumer slowdown—slower spending in discretionary areas likely as inflation remains above target.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonds</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stable-to-firm yields expected, but little upside for long-term rates or inflation-protected securities, with no imminent threat of stagflation or emergency monetary action.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Currencies &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>USD:</strong> FX volatility ahead, particularly against emerging markets—expect further weakness in MXN and BRL vs. USD. EUR/USD may swing, with significant chances of both lower (near 1.05) and higher (above 1.15 and possibly 1.2) prints this year, suggesting ongoing volatility rather than one-directional move.</li>
<li><strong>Oil Market:</strong> Conflicting views on year-end oil prices, with scenarios for both significant downside ($50s) and upside ($90+) seen as plausible. OPEC is not expected to enact major fresh cuts, and pipeline disruptions (e.g., TurkStream) are not base case.</li>
<li><strong>Commodities/Energy:</strong> US solar deployment remains robust but will not meet highly optimistic forecasts—strong (but not massive) installation growth supports a positive outlook for renewables, but not at the scale to disrupt utility/gas quickly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cryptocurrencies</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum:</strong> Crypto prices have substantial upside tails: probabilities support both medium/high Bitcoin values (~$130k–$150k) and high Ethereum values ($5k–$7k+) by year's end, even if the most extreme outcomes ($1 million BTC, $10k ETH) are unlikely. Downside volatility risk is seen as low near term.</li>
<li><strong>Regulation:</strong> Ripple and DOGE ETFs appear likely to be approved in 2025, further legitimizing parts of the crypto space.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology &amp; Regulation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Regulation Risk:</strong> The US government taking direct control of an AI project before 2030 remains a non-base-case but meaningfully possible risk, likely heightened by rapid advances or national security incidents. Large techs (Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft) may face increased compliance and regulatory risk, especially if political pressure mounts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Antitrust &amp; Legal</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Live Nation:</strong> There is a solid chance the courts will designate Live Nation as a monopoly before 2030—expect sector ripple effects via tougher antitrust scrutiny in entertainment/ticketing.</li>
<li><strong>Defense/Industrial:</strong> Sustained tensions in US-Europe relations and Trump’s trade policies have prompted allies to threaten to cut planned F-35 orders—potential negative read-through for US defense primes exposed to exports.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitical Risks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Russia/Ukraine:</strong> Prospects remain low for a 2025 ceasefire. Unilateral deals between US and Russia are possible, but Ukrainian acquiescence is unlikely. No evidence of imminent NATO/EU direct military involvement.</li>
<li><strong>Middle East:</strong> Risk of mass relocation or major US involvement in Gaza in 2025 is not base case, but remains more than zero. Any escalation could impact energy, commodities, or select defense equities.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Noteworthy Individual Names &amp; Themes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple:</strong> Focus on AI, robotics, and home hardware signals potential new product cycle disruptors—keep an eye on Apple’s ability to leverage AI to differentiate.</li>
<li><strong>Defense Contractors (Lockheed/F-35):</strong> Watch for continued uncertainty in non-US demand, potential defense sector volatility from trans-Atlantic policy disputes and tariff threats.</li>
<li><strong>Carvana:</strong> High chance of S&amp;P 500 inclusion could drive index demand and serve as a liquidity event.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Second/Third-Order Effects To Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consumer Slowdown:</strong> Profit margin pressure, especially in non-essential sectors; inflation and tariffs continue to erode purchasing power even as official wage growth keeps up.</li>
<li><strong>Tariff Pass-Through:</strong> Inflation can remain sticky if new tariffs drive up input prices; consumer-facing sectors and importers may bear the brunt.</li>
<li><strong>AI/Big Tech Regulation:</strong> While takeover risk is not base case, legislative headwinds remain for the largest, most systemically important AI/tech players.</li>
<li><strong>Sovereign Debt:</strong> Ongoing US fiscal expansion and high debt levels are long-term risks for Treasurys and the dollar but unlikely to trigger instability soon.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Summary Investment Stance</h2>
<ul>
<li>Remain constructive on US large caps, especially tech, but expect volatility spikes.</li>
<li>US Treasurys offer stability but limited upside; inflation-protected vehicles less attractive absent an inflationary surge.</li>
<li>Energy and commodities face mixed outlooks; favoring high-quality over speculative names.</li>
<li>Crypto remains a high-beta, high-upside asset class with further regulatory legitimization likely.</li>
<li>Macro risks: Watch for any major surprise in Fed/yield trajectories or material global escalation in Ukraine or the Middle East.</li>
</ul>
