<h2>Macro &amp; Global Developments</h2>
<h3>Monetary Policy, Inflation &amp; Growth</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sticky Inflation:</strong> Producer price inflation came in higher than expected, spooking markets. Market participants expect core inflation for 2025 to remain above 3%, with moderate risk of it holding above 4%. Wage growth is likely to outpace inflation this year, but only modestly.</li>
<li><strong>Growth Outlook:</strong> US GDP growth for 2025 is seen as most likely in the 1.5–2.5% annual range—consistent with neither a boom nor a recession. A recession in 2025 is viewed as unlikely, but global growth is mixed: risk of recessions is high in Japan, the UK, and Germany.</li>
<li><strong>US Debt &amp; Fiscal Policy:</strong> US total debt will likely exceed $38T by year-end. The government is expected to boost spending by several hundred billion in 2025, leaning fiscal policy more expansionary and possibly sustaining deficit pressures. Another US credit downgrade remains a concern, albeit not the base case.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rates &amp; Bonds</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fed Policy:</strong> Fed is overwhelmingly expected to cut rates in 2025 (rather than hike), but cuts will be gradual—most likely between 1 and 2 moves by year-end, rather than a deep cutting cycle. Market is pricing in end-2025 rates around the 3.5–4% level, above the pre-pandemic average, with little risk of emergency cuts or hikes.</li>
<li><strong>Quantitative Tightening:</strong> Fed’s balance sheet will shrink, but not dramatically—most likely remaining around $7T.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitical Risks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US-Russia-Ukraine:</strong> Active summit diplomacy between the US and Russia; tone signals potential deal-making but continued war in Ukraine remains likely. No near-term ceasefire is expected, and the US is unlikely to recognize Russian claims over Crimea in 2025. Defense and energy sectors retain risk premium.</li>
<li><strong>China:</strong> South China Sea tensions remain high after recent naval incidents. Odds of China overtaking the US economy by 2030 remain relatively low; a China recession is not likely in the near term, but there are ongoing stressors.</li>
<li><strong>Japan:</strong> A sizable probability of government change and a pronounced risk of a large earthquake before 2030, both of which could add instability to the JPY and local markets.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Level: Key Themes</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI IPOs Stalled:</strong> OpenAI and Anthropic IPOs are both unlikely to arrive soon; OpenAI would likely come first when it does emerge, but generally no AI “stampede” toward public markets in the near term.</li>
<li><strong>Semiconductors:</strong> US chip production will grow robustly, with clear support for onshoring and continued dominance from megacaps like Nvidia (expected to remain the world’s largest company). Nvidia earnings should see recurring attention to datacenter/enterprise/China and networking, with sovereign and AI-related contracts standing out.</li>
<li><strong>Tech Layoffs:</strong> Risk of more tech layoffs vs. last year remains high, signaling persistent efficiency drives even in large-cap tech.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil &amp; Gas:</strong> WTI oil is seen as more likely to stay contained or volatile downward—sub-$70/bbl more likely than a surge above $90. Natural gas prices are likely to be above $3, possibly even above $4, reflecting risks on the supply/demand side.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Transition:</strong> US solar capacity additions will continue at an elevated rate, but below the most optimistic forecasts—suggests headroom but not a full green “boom.”</li>
<li><strong>Copper/Trade:</strong> US tariffs on copper are considered reasonably likely before 2026, potentially disrupting global industrial supply chains.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Reserves:</strong> No strong concern about a critically low US oil reserve.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Asset Management &amp; Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>ETF Inflows:</strong> Major asset managers (e.g., BlackRock) are seeing strong ETF flows, with enthusiasm for digital assets, Aladdin (analytics), and private markets.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong> Bitcoin is expected to stay strong and could breach $130,000 by year end, but odds of a meteoric run to $250K or more are still low. Risk of a USDT depeg or significant US government crypto reserves acquisition remains very remote.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI-for-Health:</strong> Major AI-driven advances are happening in drug discovery, opening opportunity for biopharma and digital health.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer Health:</strong> Notable secular trend of declining alcohol consumption in the US; tail risks for traditional alcohol and related sectors.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Companies &amp; Notable Names</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia (NVDA):</strong> Remains a dominant force in value creation, with several key verticals (datacenter, gaming, AI) showing strength; little risk of CEO change, though increased regulatory and geographic risk as China mentions persist.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft/Apple:</strong> Little chance of overtaking Nvidia for top market cap; both remain comparatively stable with no imminent executive shake-ups.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon:</strong> Andy Jassy is secure as CEO. Twitch (Amazon subsidiary) CEO position is stable.</li>
<li><strong>Stripe/Klarna:</strong> Fintech IPOs are delayed, with Klarna likely to move sooner than Stripe; investors seeking exposure to “next-gen” fintech may need patience.</li>
<li><strong>SpaceX/Starlink:</strong> High cadence of Starlink launches in 2025, but no IPO soon.</li>
<li><strong>Ulta/Target:</strong> End of their in-store partnership alters retail/beauty landscape.</li>
<li><strong>Tapestry (Coach):</strong> Tariffs are eroding profit outlooks—broader warning for US consumer brands with Chinese exposure.</li>
<li><strong>Apple:</strong> Product pipeline newsflow active, regulatory threats on hold after recent legal win, and AI-driven features coming to hardware.</li>
<li><strong>BlackRock:</strong> Expected to highlight digital assets, record AUM, and ongoing ETF/private market inflows.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Key Risks &amp; Opportunities (Second/Third-Order Effects)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Prolonged sticky inflation may limit broad equity upside and shift flows toward value sectors, TIPS, and commodity exposure. Watch for rotation away from higher-multiple tech in the event of rate volatility.</li>
<li>Strong semis/AI momentum will favor infrastructure and supply chain intermediaries—benefits likely to accrue beyond just Nvidia (e.g., cloud infrastructure, AI software licenses, US manufacturing).</li>
<li>Defensive/healthcare and non-discretionary retail may gain both from macro uncertainty and from generational shifts in US consumption patterns (e.g., alcohol, wellness).</li>
<li>Geopolitical flashpoints (Ukraine, Middle East, Taiwan/South China Sea) remain outsized tail risks—defense, energy, and insurance sectors maintain elevated premiums.</li>
<li>Changing fiscal landscape (government spending, deficit) may increase volatility in USD and US treasury markets; possible benefit to gold, TIPS, and non-dollar assets in the event of another credit scare.</li>
<li>No near-term catalyst for crypto blowups or regulatory overhauls, but momentum continues in institutional digital asset adoption.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Summary Thesis</h2>
<p>The US economy is transitioning into a slower but resilient growth regime, wrestling with persistent inflation and moderate fiscal tailwinds. Monetary easing is on the table but won’t be dramatic. Tech mega-caps—especially those exposed to semiconductors and AI infrastructure—retain leadership, but broad equity upside may be capped relative to the exuberance of 2023–2024. Second-order sectoral rotation may benefit value, defensive, and energy names. Geopolitical and climate-driven “black swan” risks remain present but are not base case scenarios for now. Remain alert to rapid shifts in cross-asset correlations around major political or trade escalations, and keep dry powder for episodic dislocations stemming from policy surprises or external shocks.</p>
