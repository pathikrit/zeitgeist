<h2>Macro—Economic and Geopolitical Themes</h2>
<h3>Growth, Inflation, and Recession</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Soft Landing Still the Consensus:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Markets heavily discount a US recession in 2025; GDP growth expectations moderate in the 1–2.5% range.</li>
<li>Fed unlikely to raise rates or act on emergency basis, fostering benign conditions for risk assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Persistent Debt Accumulation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>US federal debt trending above $38 trillion for 2025 as additional fiscal expansion remains likely.</li>
<li>Substantial government outlays, but little pressure for large spending cuts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inflation Picture:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Inflation is expected to remain above the Fed’s target (in the ~2.5–3.5% range), yet not spiking out of control.</li>
<li>Wage growth modestly outpacing inflation, supporting consumer power but limiting prospects for an aggressive Fed pivot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tariffs and Trade Disruption:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New tariffs could reignite inflationary supply chain risks and dampen select global trade flows.</li>
<li>Countries like the UK, Germany, and Japan face heightened recession risks amid global softness and trade tensions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Hotspots &amp; Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Middle East Volatility:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Renewed Israeli offensive in Gaza City elevates regional energy price risk and global volatility, though direct global supply shocks are not assumed as base case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New US Immigration, Census &amp; Security Orders:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Policy uncertainty on population, redistricting, and law enforcement; potential to ripple through housing, local government, and risk-asset allocation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Europe and Asia:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Japan’s rally bucking regional trends; Germany and UK economic prospects shaky.</li>
<li>Armenia-Azerbaijan peace deal signals US diplomatic activism but potential Russian/Turkish response.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sector Themes</h2>
<h3>Energy, Commodities, Renewables</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Energy Mix Unlikely to Shift Rapidly:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Oil and coal remain primary sources of global energy through 2030, with biofuels, wind, and solar growing but not becoming dominant.</li>
<li>Near-term solar installation in the US will continue at a brisk clip, but not at record-breaking rates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Oil Price Outlook:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Oil prices expected to be capped, with moderate odds of drops below $65 and limited pressure for much higher spikes unless geopolitical escalation materializes.</li>
<li>Strategic Petroleum Reserve levels remain stable; limited change in state-led intervention.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology &amp; Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>IPO Pipeline Remains Sluggish:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stripe, Klarna, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ramp, and Brex unlikely to see imminent IPOs, though OpenAI is viewed as the likeliest tech unicorn to go public next.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>US Tech Layoffs Persist:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tech layoffs are ticking above last year's pace, underscoring ongoing labor market adjustment in the sector.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI Leadership &amp; Antitrust Watch:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nvidia favored to be the largest company globally by year-end, further cementing AI leadership.</li>
<li>Ongoing scrutiny of tech giants (Amazon, Apple, Live Nation) with significant court decisions expected around antitrust and monopolistic practices, raising long-term regulatory risk profiles for tech and media giants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials &amp; Asset Management</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>ETF and Alternatives Flows Strong:</strong>
<ul>
<li>BlackRock earnings anticipated to highlight inflows and strong digital/alternative asset themes as private markets and crypto draw investor attention.</li>
<li>Regulatory tailwinds (e.g., 401(k) reforms) could accelerate retail and institutional move into non-traditional assets.</li>
<li>Asset managers likely to benefit from continued AUM growth and innovation in platforms like Aladdin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consumer, Healthcare &amp; Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Media &amp; Entertainment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Media sector consolidation (Paramount-Skydance) reflects shifting content dynamics and scale requirements to compete with tech.</li>
<li>Court actions vs. Disney and settlement news illustrate ongoing content rights and labor cost challenges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Healthcare Policy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cutbacks in mRNA vaccine funding add a new risk factor to biotech growth narrative.</li>
<li>New research (lithium for Alzheimer’s, diabetes risk &amp; diet) may shift long-term focus in the pharmaceutical and wellness sectors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Housing, Insurance, and Utilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Climate &amp; Natural Disaster Risks:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Wildfires in Southern California emphasize ongoing liability risks for insurers and utilities, plus structural supply/demand imbalances in local housing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Individual Companies to Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia (NVDA):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Well-positioned as the likely global market cap leader, with continued momentum across datacenter, automotive, and AI verticals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Oracle (ORCL):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cloud, RPO, multicloud, AI, capital expenditure, and OpenAI partnership themes likely to figure prominently in coming earnings, with attention on valuation sustainability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>BlackRock (BLK):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Highlighting net inflows, digital assets, and private market themes; growth in ETF business expected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Amazon, Apple, Live Nation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Facing substantial antitrust and monopoly risk through multi-year litigation; ongoing regulatory overhang could affect multiples.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tesla, SpaceX (private):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Elon Musk’s wealth trajectory remains impressive, though direct public market impact is longer-term; Starlink/SpaceX IPOs not anticipated soon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>The macro setup remains constructive for equities, absent an exogenous shock or dramatic policy action, though forward returns may moderate from prior years.</li>
<li>Persistent inflation and government debt build-up point to risks in longer duration bonds, but limited expectations of a policy panic.</li>
<li>Geopolitical and climate events can trigger short-term volatility, especially for energy and regional insurance sectors.</li>
<li>Tech continues to dominate leadership narrative, but with rising regulatory scrutiny and labor market churn.</li>
<li>Shifting US fiscal, trade, and regulatory policies are the key second-order drivers to monitor for market regime change.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Monitor for turns in the inflation trend, new major policy shocks, or meaningful escalations in geopolitical tensions, any of which could break the relative calm currently expected by the street.</strong></p>
