<h2>Macro &amp; US Policy</h2>
<h3>Growth, Inflation &amp; Monetary Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>GDP Growth:</strong> US economic growth for 2025 is expected to moderate, with a soft landing more likely than a sharp recession. Most scenarios cluster around sluggish expansion (1–2.5%), while robust growth (&gt;3%) is highly unlikely. Recession risk remains low but not negligible.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Persistent core and headline inflation pressures suggest CPI will run between 2.5–3% YoY in the coming months. Upside risks to inflation are notable, fueled by elevated rents, geopolitical uncertainty, and a still-tight labor market.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market:</strong> Unemployment will likely drift above 4%, reflecting a cooling but intact jobs market. Monthly job gains are expected to be modest and falling short of post-pandemic expansion levels. Wage growth is projected to outpace inflation, bolstering consumer spending.</li>
<li><strong>Fed Policy &amp; Rates:</strong> Market expectations are increasingly dovish—no rate hikes are projected for 2025, with several members of the Fed signaling a bias toward multiple rate cuts to support the cooling economy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal &amp; Geopolitical</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Debt:</strong> National debt is virtually certain to breach $38 trillion, raising long-term concerns about Treasury supply, potential crowd-out effects, and future fiscal sustainability.</li>
<li><strong>Government Shutdown:</strong> Roughly even odds for a government shutdown emerging due to still-contentious fiscal debates in Congress; would add some volatility to risk assets and dampen macro visibility if realized.</li>
<li><strong>Tariffs &amp; Trade:</strong> Expect elevated tariffs to become a meaningful source of government revenue (~$200–300B), with further consumer goods price increases and supply chain adjustments for multinationals. Watch for new US trade activity and renegotiated deals, though few breakthroughs with major partners are imminent.</li>
<li><strong>US Dollar:</strong> Deteriorating dollar strength, driven by fiscal and trade factors, adds a layer of currency risk for multinationals and favor exporters in global equity allocation.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Major Sectors</h2>
<h3>Real Estate</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rent Inflation:</strong> Strong rent growth in urban centers (NYC, SF), with both cities likely to record well above average rent increases. This will feed into inflation metrics and support cash flows in multifamily REITs and related asset classes, but may pressure affordability and regional migration trends.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil &amp; Gas:</strong> Oil prices are expected to remain range-bound with bias toward the downside in WTI, barring major new geopolitical shocks. Gasoline prices in Texas and California will stay elevated, putting pressure on consumer discretionary spending in those regions but supporting energy sector margins.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Watchpoints:</strong> Mideast and Eurasian regional instability (Gaza, Iran, Caucasus corridor) are low-probability but high-impact risks for energy price volatility.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consumer &amp; Retail</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consumer Strength:</strong> Slightly positive real wage growth underpins ongoing resilience in consumer discretionary, especially tech hardware and travel/leisure, even as rent and fuel pricing stress household budgets.</li>
<li><strong>Retail Pricing:</strong> Tariffs feeding through to higher prices for apparel, autos, and household goods, potentially shifting consumption patterns and benefiting discount retail, home brands with strong domestic supply chains, and private-label offerings.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology &amp; Media</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tech Demand:</strong> Discounting on Apple products may signal inventory clearing or a bid to maintain market share; watch for margin compression in hardware but potentially strong back-to-school sales.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto in Retirement:</strong> Regulatory signals plus media attention pave way for slow adoption of crypto in retirement plans—long-term positive for crypto infrastructure, but near-term impact likely muted.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>International / Emerging Markets</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Currency Volatility:</strong> MXN and BRL showing weakness; emerging market FX exposures require additional monitoring as de-dollarization themes and Fed cuts pressure risk appetite and capital flows.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Flashpoints:</strong> US diplomatic maneuvers (Alaska summit, UN moves, trade pacts) and ongoing tensions in Asia (China/Taiwan/Philippines, India border) should be monitored for shifts that could disrupt supply chains (notably in semiconductors, consumer electronics, and exports).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Companies / Names to Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple:</strong> Near-term sales bump likely from aggressive discounting, but longer-term, margin risks if promotional activity persists given inflation-driven cost base.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto/Finance Providers:</strong> Brokerages and record-keepers anticipating demand for new 401(k) offerings; regulatory risk remains high.</li>
<li><strong>Select REITs:</strong> Urban multifamily and coastal property owners could outperform as rents escalate, despite rising property taxes and insurance costs.</li>
<li><strong>Major US Exporters/Multinationals:</strong> Weakening dollar may support near-term earnings but introduces volatility and hedging costs, especially in consumer and industrials.</li>
<li><strong>TSMC/Semiconductor Supply Chain:</strong> Remain attentive to any developments in cross-Straits relations; any escalation would be acutely disruptive for global technology sector.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Key Second-Order Effects</h2>
<ul>
<li>Shrinking real disposable income in high-rent metros may drive internal migration, shift housing demand to Sunbelt and Midwest, alter retail sales mix, and impact local tax bases.</li>
<li>Weakening US dollar may catalyze flows into commodities and alternative assets.</li>
<li>Political and fiscal uncertainty (government shutdown, redistricting, policing) will support volatility trades, create risk premiums in Treasuries, and may further influence sectoral rotations.</li>
<li>Elevated tariffs and trade policy become more central to earnings outlooks for US consumer goods, importers, and international supply chain-reliant companies.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Overall:</strong> Stay selectively constructive on US equities, with sector tilts toward consumer resilient segments, real asset inflation plays, and internationally diversified exporters. Maintain vigilance for signs of accelerating inflation or geopolitical flare-ups that could rapidly alter the macro and risk landscape. Consider volatility hedges and active EM currency management.</p>
