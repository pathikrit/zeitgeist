</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Geopolitical Environment</h2>
<h3>US Rate Expectations &amp; Growth</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rate cuts: The base case is now for 1-2 Fed cuts by end-2025, with little/no chance of rate hikes or emergency moves. This anchors real yields and underpins continued risk asset support.</li>
<li>US recession: Odds remain low for a downturn before year-end. Fiscal stand-offs (e.g., government shutdown, new tariffs) are an ongoing catalysis threat, but not the dominant scenario.</li>
<li>Treasury yields: Slightly increased expectations for the 10-year to test mid-4% territory, but no broad runaway inflation or bond crisis currently anticipated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal/Tax Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>No material reforms or abolishment of income/cap gains tax for 2025; headline risk possible but not baseline.</li>
<li>Government shutdown risk is elevated versus prior years, which could spark pockets of volatility in TIPS, defensives, and short-term rates.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global/Emerging Market Themes</h3>
<ul>
<li>US-India relations souring (high tariffs) can disrupt EM supply chains, Indian equities, and bolster the argument for multi-polar trade hedging.</li>
<li>French political instability may prompt additional safe-haven capital rotation into US bonds/equities as European risk premiums rise.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitical Tension</h3>
<ul>
<li>Middle East: Renewed Gaza conflict points to persistent supply/price risk in energy; further escalation (Yemen, Iran operations) would amplify.</li>
<li>Ukraine/NATO risk remains on the backburner, not immediate but a wildcard for defense/commodity pricing.</li>
<li>China and trade unresolved but not at immediate escalation point.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li>AI: OpenAI and Anthropic continue aggressive platform and product expansion (including recent Claude agent). IPO timelines for top names (OpenAI, Anthropic, Stripe, Starlink, SpaceX) seem to be drifting further out; immediate retail access remains unlikely.</li>
<li>Regulation: Antitrust scrutiny on Amazon, Apple, and Live Nation intensifying—watch for legal precedents potentially affecting margins or business models in consumer and tech platforms.</li>
<li>AI Hardware &amp; Semis: Nvidia's sector dominance is close to a consensus, but earnings set up for volatility—major disappointment would shock indices and beta names. Microsoft and Apple at risk of continued market share/mindshare erosion in AI race.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials</h3>
<ul>
<li>Major bank/CEOs: JPMorgan CEO succession (Lake and Rohrbaugh most likely), but little sectoral risk unless highly unexpected outcome.</li>
<li>BlackRock: Strong flows in digital assets and private markets; revenue/AUM expectations remain robust. Regulatory change, if any, more a headwind to niche players than to giants.</li>
<li>Treasury/corporate crypto: More S&amp;P 500 companies expected to hold or transact in crypto, deepening institutional footprint.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin and Ethereum: Upside base case, but none of the extreme price targets ($250k+) appear credible near-term. Mid-double to triple digit targets ($130k BTC, $5-6k ETH) more realistic if risk sentiment remains elevated.</li>
<li>Stablecoins (Tether/USDT): Systemic risk from major depeg/solvency event viewed as remote for 2025.</li>
<li>Crypto ETFs and regulation: High probability for Ripple and DOGE ETF launches, continuing to mainstream these assets.</li>
<li>US move toward national bitcoin reserve or de minimis tax exemption remains unlikely, but watch for incremental policy shifts that could move sentiment/multiples.</li>
<li>Gold: Consensus for new record high—$3,200+—by end 2025 as the dominant scenario, reflecting broad macro hedge demand and skepticism about fiat/fiscal management.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy, Infrastructure, Industrials</h3>
<ul>
<li>Energy market: Climate/weather volatility continues to impact insurance and utility pricing (hurricanes, dust storms); not seeing an immediate catastrophic event ahead, but energy and insurance names will remain volatile around forecast updates through hurricane season.</li>
<li>Renewables: Talk of nuclear fusion progress is increasing, but no step change to utility/energy cash flows in the investable window.</li>
<li>Aerospace/Space: SpaceX success cements new infrastructure leadership; IPO unlikely near-term, but Starlink/SpaceX milestones benefit US manufacturing and global telecom narratives.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare/Biotech</h3>
<ul>
<li>Guidance expands for preventative cardiovascular vaccination and xenotransplant breakthroughs. Both signal structural demand for advanced therapies, diagnostics, and medical services—positive for diversified healthcare, especially as populations age.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Key Companies and Catalysts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple</strong>: Event-driven run-up into iPhone announcement; antitrust and shifting competitive position in AI are risks to watch.</li>
<li><strong>Nvidia</strong>: High expectation bar for next earnings—either reinforcing or destabilizing broader tech sentiment.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI/Anthropic</strong>: Ongoing legal and product risks, but damaging CEO exits in '25 are low odds; next big catalyst would come with an IPO signal or major regulatory lawsuit.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon &amp; Live Nation</strong>: Ongoing antitrust headlines; prolonged battles could weigh on margin and discretionary segments.</li>
<li><strong>Stripe, Klarna</strong>: Klarna's IPO looking highly likely—and soon, ahead of Stripe, Deel, or other unicorns; supports fintech sector multiples if well-received.</li>
<li><strong>Oracle/BlackRock</strong>: Oracle's AI/cloud shift and BlackRock's asset inflows/private market expansion remain favored themes; their next earnings will test this narrative.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla, Google</strong>: Management risk appears overblown, not expected to change this year.</li>
<li><strong>MicroStrategy</strong>: Not expected to sell its bitcoin; remains a bellwether for corporate treasury crypto conversion.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Second &amp; Third Order Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Secondary impact from US-India and France-related trade shocks could mean more reshoring, more defensive sector outperformance, and less EM optimism through 2025.</li>
<li>AI legal and regulatory pressure will gradually increase compliance costs for platform companies—potentially forcing margin reevaluations for high-profile cloud/consumer platforms.</li>
<li>Weather and catastrophe insurance pricing likely to ratchet higher, with knock-on effects for mortgage, property, and energy names. Biotech/healthcare innovation could spur new VC/IPO interest, while established players benefit from defensiveness.</li>
<li>Global political risk (tariffs, military action, legislative gridlock) creating pockets of volatility—expect tactical opportunities in macro hedges (gold, crypto, short duration bonds) on escalation headlines.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Actionable Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stay neutral to positive on broad US equities and tech, but prepare for volatility around Nvidia, Apple, and rate policy events.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Overweight gold and keep crypto as a macro hedge—both benefit from persistent policy/fiscal risk and institutionalization trends.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Watch for fintech and healthcare innovation as thematic bright spots in later '25.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Be prepared to rebalance on outsized geopolitical, macro, or regulatory shocks, especially in consumer and tech platforms.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Continue monitoring antitrust/regulatory momentum, and prep for further safe-haven rotation if French/EM or US fiscal events escalate.</strong></li>
</ul>
