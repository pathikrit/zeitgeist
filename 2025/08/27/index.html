<h2>Macro &amp; Market Overview</h2>
<h3>US Macroeconomic Outlook</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Inflation and Rates:</strong> Inflation is expected to be moderate (most likely range for 2025 is 2.6–3.5%), with core inflation slightly higher. The base case is a continued, gradual decline in both headline and core inflation, but with a floor above pre-2020 norms. Interest rates are likely to remain well above the post-COVID lows, but further aggressive hikes appear off the table for 2025. Cuts are likely, but pace and scale will be modest—expect two cuts as the consensus, with 3+ cuts seen as unlikely.</p>
<ul>
<li>Second-order: Stable, but ‘sticky’ inflation increases risk premiums for long-duration assets, supports preference for floating rate, short-to-intermediate bonds, and TIPS over long-term fixed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Economic Growth:</strong> US GDP most likely to trend modestly positive (1–2% range) in 2025; sharp booms or deep recessions are seen as unlikely. Probability of near-term US recession remains below historical averages despite global headwinds, but Europe (esp. France, Germany, UK) and Japan are at clear risk of downturn.</p>
<ul>
<li>Second-order: US equities likely to outperform ex-US; cyclicals/industrials may lag defensives and tech.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Labor Market:</strong> Unemployment seen gradually rising but not spiking (high single digits possible, but ultra-high rates remain remote). Wages are generally expected to outpace inflation, sustaining consumer spending.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep an eye on labor tightness, especially with possible union/labor policy disruptions under new administration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fiscal &amp; Debt Concerns:</strong> Continued upward drift in US national debt (virtually certain to breach $38T by year-end, with pathways above $45T clearing). Even with possible fiscal retrenchment under Trump, immediate spending cuts are not a base case. Deficits remain high, but acute fiscal stress (default or outright crisis) unlikely in the near term.</p>
<ul>
<li>Second/third order: Elevated debt may gradually lift the term premium on treasuries and spill over into risk asset pricing, but US dollar still seen as reserve anchor unless capital controls materialize.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Policy and Political Developments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Supreme Court:</strong> Conservative majority cemented, but no near-term change to court size; volatility from possible resignations and policy decisions expected.
<ul>
<li>Watch for decisions affecting social policy and potential institutional risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fed Policy:</strong> Continuity in monetary policy, but appointments and headline risk likely to cause intermittent volatility around central bank independence.</li>
<li><strong>China, India, Trade:</strong> Heightened trade tension, especially with India. Tariffs will pressure multinational cost structures, EM equities/currencies, and supply chains.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitics:</strong> Ongoing risks in Middle East, Russia-Ukraine, and possible snap events (France confidence vote). Raise vigilance for global risk-off events.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Theme Focus</h2>
<h3>Tech &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>IPO Pipeline:</strong> OpenAI is viewed as the most likely next AI major to pursue an IPO. Anthropic remains a strong story but is now facing significant IP settlement exposure.
<ul>
<li>Second-order: Late-stage private AI and cloud infrastructure valuations likely to anchor next tech bull cycle; monitor regulatory/antitrust headwinds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Antitrust &amp; Mega-Caps:</strong> Risks to Amazon, Apple (and peers like Alphabet, Tesla) from ongoing and likely future antitrust litigation remain elevated, particularly on market structure and monopoly status. Market may price in multipliers on downside as these cases advance.
<ul>
<li>Second-order: Legal pressure could limit upside in big tech and spark rotation into mid-/small-caps or non-tech defensives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Semiconductors:</strong> Robust growth in domestic chip production (&gt;7%) looks secure, supported by ongoing AI/edge demand—look for continued capex cycles and sustained leadership by names like Nvidia (noting elevated volatility around earnings).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Utilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy Mix (2030 Outlook):</strong> Oil and coal remain dominant globally by 2030; renewables (solar, wind, biofuels) expand but do not become majority sources within five years. Gas remains key transitional fuel.
<ul>
<li>Immediate implication: Carbon transition portfolios should stay long legacy energy/commodities while selectively overweighting US solar (steady, not explosive deployment growth expected this year).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Prices:</strong> WTI oil prices expected to remain bounded; the upside above $100 is remote, with downside below $65 more likely; OPEC may cut but not aggressively enough to reverse trends.
<ul>
<li>Gasoline: US state differentials continue—California prices moderating, Texas more volatile. Watch US energy policy/tariff shocks for surprise moves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Nuclear:</strong> Momentum toward nuclear-powered infrastructure (e.g., data centers on military bases) is real but gradual; major new reactor licenses are not imminent, limiting utilities’ nuclear upside in the near term.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Biotech</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Managed Care:</strong> While wholesale repeal of Obamacare remains low probability, incremental policy/justice changes could affect managed care profitability. Watch for court rulings or federal reimbursements.</li>
<li><strong>Biotech Disruption:</strong> First gene-edited pig lung transplant (China) signals a potential coming wave of cross-species organ/biotech advances, increasing optionality in life sciences/biotech sectors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials &amp; Bonds</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yield Curve &amp; Bond Market:</strong> Flatter curve as short rates remain anchored and 10–30Y yields sensitive to deficit expansion. No rate hikes expected in 2025; risk-on for shorter/intermediate duration credit, but longer maturities may remain under pressure from fiscal dynamics.
<ul>
<li>US dollar likely to remain strong, but any unexpected move towards capital controls or Fed independence could spark sell-offs in treasuries and hit EM currencies hard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Equity Market Outlook:</strong> S&amp;P 500 is expected to finish strongly positive, with limited risk of major drawdown. There is still non-trivial scenario risk tied to superstar tech earnings (notably Nvidia), court decisions, or geopolitical flashpoints.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Names/Events</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>OpenAI, Anthropic:</strong> OpenAI more likely to IPO first; Anthropic settles its high-profile copyright dispute, removing a key overhang.</li>
<li><strong>Apple:</strong> Event slated for September 9; expects major hardware/AI announcements, likely to drive near-term share volatility amid looming antitrust scrutiny.</li>
<li><strong>Nvidia:</strong> Results could be the biggest individual near-term US market volatility trigger; any material miss could cause sector-wide spillover.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon &amp; Live Nation:</strong> Both face meaningful risk of adverse antitrust judgments before 2030. Live Nation particularly exposed.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla, Google, Microsoft:</strong> Remain potential FTC targets; ongoing regulatory scrutiny could cap upside or introduce jumps in volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Cracker Barrel:</strong> Stock moves higher on public/political controversy; illustrates second-order effects of social reaction on brand equities.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Watchlist &amp; Near-Term Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li>French political instability could spill into EU markets—watch for elevated volatility and government bond spreads.</li>
<li>US-India tariff escalation threatens to disrupt supply chains; negative spillover to select industrials and global exporters.</li>
<li>Middle East and Russia-Ukraine conflicts keep energy and defense sectors in play; any escalation could quickly reprice commodities.</li>
<li>US domestic policy shifts, especially around Fed independence, labor, or capital controls, would have swift bond and currency impacts.</li>
<li>Increasing institutional risk to Supreme Court, Fed, and judiciary—uncertainty premium may rise around future court compositions and decisions.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br />
Maintain an overweight on US equities, with an eye to volatility from tech earnings and regulatory news. Favor short-to-intermediate bonds and real assets given deficit and inflation dynamics. Be tactical on energy—legacy fuels remain central, but selective renewables have momentum. Stay alert for policy/political shocks domestically and abroad. AI, semis, and select healthcare/biotech offer optionality, but monoline tech bets face more asymmetric regulatory downside as the cycle matures.</p>
