<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Economic Outlook</h2>
<h3>Economic Growth &amp; Inflation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>GDP growth for 2025 is expected to be modest</strong>, with consensus expecting growth to remain positive but subdued (most weight on 1–2% range). The risk of outright recession in the next 12 months remains present but does not dominate the consensus narrative.</li>
<li><strong>Core inflation and headline CPI remain above pre-pandemic levels</strong>, with persistent expectations for inflation in the 3–4% range. Wage growth is forecast to slightly outpace inflation, but upside real wage momentum is limited.</li>
<li><strong>US debt continues to mount</strong>, with sovereign debt on track to set new highs through year-end, maintaining background fiscal risk.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Second-order Effects:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Disinflation is slow; real yields may remain positive but not high, supporting demand for some yield assets and inflation protection.</li>
<li>Sticky inflation complicates the Fed’s job, especially if labor markets weaken quicker than expected.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Labor Market &amp; Wages</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unemployment rate now likely above 4% and rising</strong>; tech sector layoffs could intensify in 2025.</li>
<li>Payroll growth appears soft; expectations for robust job gains are muted.</li>
<li><strong>Wage growth outstripping inflation</strong> provides some cushion for consumption, but not enough to drive robust growth.</li>
<li>Corporate margins face renewed cost pressure if layoffs increase but inflation remains sticky.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Second/Third-Order Effects:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Weakening labor market can hit cyclical sectors and consumer discretionary spending first.</li>
<li>Persistent layoffs in tech may drive down software/IT wage inflation, changing input pricing for service sectors, but may dampen growth narratives for large-cap tech.</li>
<li>A softer jobs backdrop could reinforce the narrative for a dovish Fed, even as inflation lingers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Monetary Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fed rate cuts still highly likely in 2025</strong>, though more than two cuts seem less likely; hikes are extremely unlikely.</li>
<li><strong>No clear consensus for emergency moves, but risk backdrop (government shutdown, weak jobs) could trigger policy shifts.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fed funds rate</strong>, expected to end year between 3.25%–4%, has potential implications for both duration and risk-seeking appetites.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Market impact:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long bonds may gain as rates decline, but inflation risk persists.</li>
<li>Risk assets remain tied to real economy and Fed’s response to growth/inflation mix.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Outlook</h2>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<h4>Oil &amp; Natural Gas</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>OPEC+ output hike drives oil price volatility</strong>; short-term oversupply risks significant downward price pressure, but range-boundiness amid external shocks possible.</li>
<li>Both extreme price falls and spikes are possible but persistent sub-$65 WTI is increasingly feasible.</li>
<li><strong>Natural gas prices are inclined higher in 2025</strong>, with most expecting sustained movement above $4. Supply/demand mismatch or global events (e.g., Russian export issues, climate) can amplify this.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Renewables/Solar</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>US solar installation in 2025 likely to continue steady growth, but not accelerate to bullish extremes</strong> (midpoint: 30–50 GWdc).</li>
<li>Unlikely to see a surge to 60+ GW; expect measured, policy-driven but not explosive capex cycle.</li>
<li>Policy, trade, and supply chain issues remain major swing factors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<h4>Semiconductors</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>US semiconductor output expected to see robust growth</strong>, with &gt;7% YoY seen as baseline. Reflects ongoing reshoring, AI/datacenter buildout, and industrial policy push.</li>
<li>Sector remains structurally strong, but cyclical volatility if broader tech/software sector faces headwinds from weakened spending or layoffs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Software/Internet/Big Tech</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tech sector layoffs are likely to rise in 2025</strong>, following last year’s trend. Margin pressure, competition, and slower digital ad/revenue growth all contribute.</li>
<li>Investors should be mindful of further cost-cutting, concentration of index risk in mega-cap tech, and secular AI shifts (e.g., Apple’s AI push vs. OpenAI stability).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Defense/Aerospace</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Boeing defense workers' strike likely to disrupt key production lines</strong> (fighter jets, possibly spillover to space &amp; civil projects).</li>
<li>Could boost peer defense contractors and secondary suppliers, but risk of delays, higher costs, and margin compression.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Markets, FX, and Credit</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>USD may weaken moderately</strong>, but no major de-dollarization event is priced for 2025. Watch for swings vs. major commodity and emerging market currencies (notably MXN, BRL).</li>
<li>Downgrade risk for US credit rating remains low/moderate; unlikely to trigger a crisis but could steepen Treasury curve and support safe-haven flows.</li>
<li><strong>Government shutdown risk is credible</strong>; would be a sentiment-negative, especially for risk assets and sectors reliant on public contracts or consumer/transfer payments.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Digital Assets &amp; Crypto</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin remains well supported by institutional adoption but faces substantial two-way risk within a wide trading range</strong>. S&amp;P 500 company adoption for treasury use to increase, but outsized price targets (&gt;250k) not widely expected in near term.</li>
<li><strong>Ethereum likely to stay below $6,000 this year; upside capped, but still favored for positive return</strong> among major tokens except Bitcoin.</li>
<li><strong>Broader crypto sector</strong>: Expectation for at least some major ripple effects from regulatory, macro or technological innovation—watch for news-driven surges or rotations.</li>
<li><strong>Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin favored tokens year to date; meme/altcoins seen as highly speculative with limited upside.</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Company &amp; Thematic Watchlist</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia</strong> expected to surpass peers for largest global market cap by year-end, driven by AI, datacenter, and chip cycle leadership.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft</strong> and <strong>Apple</strong> less likely to reclaim top spot in the short run; Apple’s AI/OS strategy an evolving wildcard but not immediate gamechanger.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI stability</strong>: Leadership risk minimal after last year’s upheaval; AI/ML ecosystem unlikely to face abrupt disruptions.</li>
<li><strong>Defense and aerospace (Boeing)</strong> face near-term labor and delivery challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Tech/content creators (Meta/Instagram)</strong>: Platform policy changes (throttling small creators) could disrupt engagement, reactively benefit other social or creator platforms; implications for ad-market supply/demand.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Special Topics &amp; Alerts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weather and disaster events</strong> (wildfires, volcanoes, earthquakes): Heightened risk to insurance, agriculture, supply chains, and power grids—monitor for sector-specific impacts.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare</strong>: Surging colon cancer in young adults and a new infectious disease cluster (measles) add to sector risk/opportunity; insurer and biotech names bear watching.</li>
<li><strong>Political Noise</strong>: Ongoing US/Statehouse gridlock and nomination battles could delay major fiscal policy, lending a “wait-and-see” note to public spending and regulatory sectors.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Takeaways &amp; Investment Implications</h2>
<ul>
<li>Expect <strong>moderate economic growth, sticky inflation, and softening job markets</strong>—position for value in income-producing assets that hedge inflation and economic risk.</li>
<li><strong>Energy and tech remain crucial battleground sectors</strong>—be tactical around supply shocks, government policy, or structural shifts (AI, energy transition).</li>
<li><strong>Digital/crypto assets</strong>: Leadership in Bitcoin and Ethereum, with selective upside in institutional adoption, but speculative excess is fading.</li>
<li><strong>Watch for labor disputes</strong> (Boeing, tech) and <strong>political events</strong> (government shutdown, Fed policy) as key volatility triggers.</li>
<li>Maintain flexibility: 2nd and 3rd order effects (supply chain, insurance claims, platform policies) may produce volatility in sub-sectors and single names, beyond headline macro trends.</li>
