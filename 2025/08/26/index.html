<h2>Macro Outlook</h2>
<h3>US Economy &amp; Fed Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>The US growth outlook appears moderate, with GDP most likely to grow around 1–2.5% in 2025, and core inflation expected in the 3–3.5% range.</li>
<li>Market consensus is for the Federal Reserve to begin lowering rates by the end of 2025, with multiple cuts likely by December, though deep or aggressive easing remains improbable.</li>
<li>Unemployment could edge higher this fall, creating possible headwinds for consumer sectors.</li>
<li>The US national debt is set to top $38 trillion by year-end, with high confidence in further annual increases, raising concerns over long-term fiscal sustainability and bond market supply.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Actionable themes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Continue to watch for upward pressure on longer-term yields; duration and inflation hedges remain prudent.</li>
<li>Credit spreads and risk premiums could widen if growth disappoints, or if political drama around the Fed escalates.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Risks &amp; Currency Markets</h3>
<ul>
<li>France’s political turmoil threatens to destabilize EU financial markets and the euro, prompting risk-off shifts into USD and treasuries in the near term.</li>
<li>Moderate ongoing de-dollarization pressure, but USD Index remains resilient barring a severe global crisis.</li>
<li>Significant geopolitical flashpoints in Europe (France, Ukraine conflict), Asia-Pacific (China, Australia-Iran tensions), and the Middle East generate higher uncertainty premiums for global assets, commodities, and defense-related sectors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Actionable themes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>EUR/USD likely to remain soft; monitor for breakout risk if French instability deepens.</li>
<li>Exposure to global commodities (especially energy), defense, and select EM risk premia adjustments warranted.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sectors &amp; Thematic</h2>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tech remains under a regulatory and antitrust cloud, both in the US and EU.
<ul>
<li>High likelihood courts will declare both Amazon and Apple as monopolies before 2030, with Live Nation facing similar challenges.</li>
<li>FTC scrutiny could intensify for Tesla, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon, with possible reputational and operational overhangs—but with slow, drawn-out legal timelines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nvidia is favored to be the world’s top market cap by year-end, reaffirming leadership in AI/semis; Microsoft and Alphabet will continue to lag in relative size.</li>
<li>Apple’s impending iPhone 17 launch could drive short-term volatility; cyclicality following product launches is a risk.</li>
<li>IPO pipeline is sluggish among high-profile tech names (OpenAI, Stripe, Starlink), with nearer-term anticipation for Klarna and OpenAI; Anduril (defense) may debut in 2026.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Actionable themes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Continue overweight to leading AI/semis; prepare for rotation on major tech event/news.</li>
<li>Remain cautious on Big Tech antitrust risks.</li>
<li>Monitor for defense, crypto, and select fintech IPO activity in 2026.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Oil and coal expected to remain substantial contributors to global primary energy through 2030; transition to renewables will be incremental and region-dependent.</li>
<li>Ukraine’s attacks on Russian refineries may create asymmetric upside shocks in energy and fertilizer prices.</li>
<li>The US is unlikely to meet 2030 climate targets; India has a higher probability of progress relative to the US and EU, implying policy tailwinds for Indian renewables and infrastructure plays.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Actionable themes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tactical overweight to energy/commodities, especially on further supply shocks.</li>
<li>Indian renewables and infrastructure appear well-positioned for multiyear policy and capital flows.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials</h3>
<ul>
<li>JPMorgan CEO transition remains open, with internal succession likely.</li>
<li>Market is alert to further Fed personnel shakeups, which may trigger volatility in rates and the financial sector.</li>
<li>Deutsche Bank-style idiosyncratic Euro bank risk could rise if EU political fragmentation deepens.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Actionable themes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Preference for US/global systemically important banks; monitor for adverse news in Eurozone banking sector.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Alternative Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Outlook for leading crypto assets is moderately bullish, with a good probability of further upside in Bitcoin and Ethereum by year-end, but extreme upside appears overstretched.</li>
<li>Crypto ETFs (Ripple, Dogecoin) likely to expand available retail/insto access in 2025; expect inflows, secondary volatility.</li>
<li>Crypto infra (DeFi, perps) expansion is progressing; regulatory environment remains key.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Actionable themes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain core crypto/ETH allocation; consider selective increases on favorable ETF approval news.</li>
<li>DeFi exposure should be adaptive to regulatory changes and new product launches.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Company-Specific</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia</strong> is strongly positioned as the likely top-cap global company; continued AI momentum remains a sector-wide driver.</li>
<li><strong>Apple</strong> faces minimal CEO risk, but price action post-iPhone 17 announcement should be monitored for mean reversions.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>Apple</strong> face significant antitrust legal battles; long-term valuation impact likely muted but watch for episodic volatility.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI</strong>: Expected to IPO before Anthropic; NYT lawsuit combined with potential &gt;$1M tort payout could shift regulatory debate and impact legal/lobbying costs across the AI sector.</li>
<li><strong>AT&amp;T</strong>’s $23B spectrum deal signals commitment to scale and compete in 5G—potentially negative for EchoStar’s rivals and synergistic for telcos and hardware partners.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Risks &amp; Notables</h2>
<ul>
<li>Natural disasters (earthquake in Japan, hurricanes Karen/Sebastien) pose moderate insurance and real-asset downside in affected geographies, though US/CA earthquake tail risks remain remote in the near term.</li>
<li>No imminent risk of Schengen or EU disintegration, but political instability (France, Hungary, Italy) raises volatility in EU assets.</li>
<li>Unlikely that China will overtake the US economy by 2030, but emerging markets remain sensitive to US-China/EU rate, FX, and trade headlines.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Summary Positioning</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stay overweight leading AI/semiconductors, Indian renewables, and US energy/commodities.</li>
<li>Maintain flexible rates and duration exposure, with a tilt toward risk-management as political/fiscal volatility rises into US and EU election cycles.</li>
<li>Monitor regulatory scrutiny in Big Tech and fintech; stay tactical around major IPO, product, or legal events.</li>
<li>Stay alert to geopolitical and commodity disruptions, balancing risk-adjusted return across global opportunity sets.</li>
</ul>
