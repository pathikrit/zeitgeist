<h1>Daily Memo (30-Aug-2025)</h1>
<hr />
<h2>News Highlights</h2>

<li><strong>Deportation Policy</strong>: Federal judge blocks Trump’s attempt to expand fast-track deportations, potentially slowing mass removal efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Aid &amp; Spending Fights</strong>: Trump cancels $4.9B in foreign aid, escalating budget tensions with Congress and risking government shutdown.</li>
<li><strong>End of ‘De Minimis’ Tariff Loophole</strong>: Small-value imports now subject to standard US tariffs, likely to disrupt global retail and e-commerce.</li>

<li><strong>Momentum in US Equities</strong>: US markets showing strong momentum into September.</li>
<li><strong>Major Product Launches</strong>: Apple and Google both set for new device launches, fueling tech sector focus.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Policy</h2>
<h3>US Fed &amp; Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The consensus continues to indicate <strong>high likelihood of Fed rate cuts</strong> later this year or early next, with almost no expectation of rate hikes or an emergency cut. While two cuts are possible, expectations are modest.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bond market</strong>: This dynamic supports a gradual move toward lower yields, slightly benefiting longer-duration bonds, but without sudden dislocations.</li>
<li><strong>Equities</strong>: Lower rates should serve as a near-term tailwind, especially for growth sectors and higher-multiple stocks.</li>
<li>Ongoing legal and political battles over Fed board appointments could inject episodic volatility if Trump succeeds in reshaping the board’s composition or policies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recession Risk</strong>: Market still sees a US recession this year as unlikely. Corporate guidance and consumer spending trends will need monitoring, but the base case remains economic resilience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trump Administration Policy</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fiscal tightening is unlikely in the near term, as is meaningful progress on corporate or high-earner tax cuts.</li>
<li>Disputes over federal spending and foreign aid signal ongoing policy uncertainty, especially with added risk of shutdowns or spending disruptions.</li>
<li>Judicial rulings may weaken Trump’s leverage over tariffs and migration, slowing or derailing major policy shifts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trade</strong>: Legal challenges to tariffs inject uncertainty, especially combined with the end of de minimis exemptions for cheap imports. This will likely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the cost of imported goods, fueling inflation for low-margin retailers and e-commerce.</li>
<li>Complicate global supply chains and create friction specifically for US-based consumer brands and logistics providers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics &amp; International</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Russia/Ukraine</strong>: Ceasefire prospects for 2025 remain unlikely, so commodity and defense sector impacts continue, supporting high energy prices and persistent defense spending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>China, Modi, Putin Meeting</strong>: The strengthening front against the US may increase trade and geopolitical tensions, affecting global capital flows and multinational earnings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Middle East &amp; Iran</strong>: Extremely low probability of breakthrough with Iran or major shifts in energy geopolitics, but always worth watching for tail risk events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Emerging Markets</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brazil’s job market looks relatively strong, supporting assets in the region compared to riskier EM peers.</li>
<li>No immediate triggers out of Africa or the Middle East for market-wide moves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Climate/Natural Disaster</h3>
<ul>
<li>Above-normal Atlantic hurricane activity is expected this season, elevating risk for insurers, reinsurers, and East Coast real estate, but barring a major landfall event, the impact is containment.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors</h2>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The tech sector remains buoyant thanks to anticipated Fed cuts and robust product cycles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple</strong> is front and center with imminent iPhone 17 launches, likely to provide a positive catalyst for both the company and its supply chain.</li>
<li><strong>Google</strong> garners positive early reviews for the Pixel 10, supporting themes in AI-driven hardware.</li>
<li>General AI and device refresh cycle optimism continues to drive momentum.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legal and regulatory risks persist around leadership changes in tech-relevant government agencies (e.g., CDC, DOJ), but no near-term, sector-wide regulatory shock is likely.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consumer &amp; Retail</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The removal of the 'de minimis' import exemption could cause price increases and margin pressures for US retailers relying on direct-from-China/Asia shipments.</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch for weaker guidance, especially from large e-commerce and discount clothing/consumer goods retailers.</li>
<li>Potential share gain for US-based, vertically integrated, or less import-dependent brands.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Entertainment and streaming remain stable, driven by consumer resilience indicators, but no single event likely to shift the sector near term.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li>CDC turmoil could impact COVID vaccine distribution and regulatory clarity, but sector fundamentals are unchanged unless new health crises emerge.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li>No imminent licensing for new US nuclear reactors; energy markets remain supported by ongoing geopolitical risk and no near-term supply shocks.</li>
<li>Oil prices likely to remain firm given geopolitical events and continued Russian conflict.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials</h3>
<ul>
<li>No major risk of disorderly events for leveraged crypto plays (such as MicroStrategy) or US banks from current policy, but volatility remains in play if policy or legal headlines intensify.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Stocks &amp; Individual Names</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong>: Likely to outperform short term on iPhone 17 event and continued consumer interest, barring supply chain surprises from new tariffs.</li>
<li><strong>Google (GOOGL/GOOG)</strong>: Positive momentum from device reviews and AI positioning.</li>
<li><strong>MicroStrategy (MSTR)</strong>: Limited immediate risk of margin call; underlying Bitcoin price remains the more volatile driver.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla (TSLA), Magnificent 7</strong>: No imminent threat of shrinking their index weight; status quo supports continued leadership by mega caps.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Trades &amp; Tactical Themes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bias toward risk assets</strong> in the near term with dovish Fed and strong equity momentum outweighing macro/policy risk.</li>
<li><strong>Cautious on pure retail importers</strong> and global e-commerce reliant on low-tariff imports; shift toward companies with domestic supply chains could benefit from new tariffs.</li>
<li><strong>Defense and energy sectors</strong> continue to benefit from a prolonged Russia/Ukraine conflict and general geopolitical risk premium.</li>
<li><strong>Longer-duration bonds</strong> may offer tactical value with likely Fed easing, but spreads and inflation expectations must be monitored carefully.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Key Risks To Monitor:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sudden policy moves on tariffs, budget shutdown risk, or trade retaliation.</li>
<li>Outlier events: natural disaster, new pandemic wave, legal escalation against Fed or other institutions.</li>
<li>Volatility from government, monetary policy, and leadership shakeups in key agencies.</li>
</ul>
