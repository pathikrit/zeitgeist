<hr />
<h2>Macroeconomic Outlook</h2>
<h3>Growth &amp; Inflation</h3>
<ul>
<li>US GDP growth in 2025 is set for below average expansion, clustering between 1%-2% (modest positive, but below trend).</li>
<li>Inflation is likely to stay above 3% through 2025, with little risk of runaway inflation (&gt;5%), but not returning to pre-2020 lows. Persistent “sticky” inflation will shape both consumer and Fed decisions.</li>
<li>Real wage growth is likely outpacing inflation in 2025 – this should help consumer-facing sectors, though retail labor dynamics are complicated by continued tech sector layoffs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rates &amp; Monetary Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Federal Reserve is not expected to hike rates again in 2025; consensus points to at least one, and likely more than one, rate cut before year-end, but major multi-cut easing is less likely barring crisis.</li>
<li>End-of-year Fed funds rate is likely above 3.5%, but well under 5%—the tightening cycle is done, but rates are not normalizing all the way back to pre-pandemic levels.</li>
<li>No perception of imminent US recession (sub-15% probability) or emergency monetary moves; however, credit-sensitive industries still face tighter-than-usual financing conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>US Debt &amp; Fiscal</h3>
<ul>
<li>US national debt will meaningfully exceed $38 trillion by year-end, increasing longer-term risk to bond valuations once macro volatility returns.</li>
<li>Mildly elevated chance (~1 in 3) of a US government shutdown in 2025. Direct short-term market impact may be modest, but potential for increased volatility in Treasury and related fixed income markets, especially if shutdowns coincide with heavy refunding schedules.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Thematic Insights</h2>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tech sector labor market: Layoffs remain considerable in 2025, particularly among larger firms. Job cuts could weigh on sentiment but also relieve wage pressures and boost margins, especially for software and platform names.</li>
<li>AI: Google expected to hold lead in consumer AI models by year-end; further suggests ongoing competitive headwinds for OpenAI and smaller players. Apple’s likely partnership with Google Gemini for Siri indicates smaller AI platforms may get squeezed.</li>
<li>Semiconductors: US manufacturing ramping rapidly—driven by policy, supply chain risk mitigation, and AI demand tailwinds. Direct beneficiaries are fab equipment makers and US-based foundries.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Oil: Volatility remains. Market expects oil prices mostly below $65, with significant probability of dips below $60 or even $50 by year-end, yet possibility of brief spikes above $85.
<ul>
<li>Implied risk: High sensitivity to both global demand slowdowns and event-driven supply shocks—energy equities exposed to both directions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Natural Gas: Prices expected to rise significantly (above $3, even $4) for 2025, likely reflecting tightening supplies or demand surges (likely weather and export demand driven).</li>
<li>Green Energy: Halting of wind farm projects signals potential federal headwinds for renewable buildout, increasing downside for utilities/renewable players and possible support for traditional energy names.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare/Pharma</h3>
<ul>
<li>No major legislative action likely to break up pharmaceutical monopolies before 2027; status quo remains for large pharma on pricing and patent protections.</li>
<li>Probability of FDA approving a psychedelic substance for medical use by 2027 is significant, presenting a medium-term optionality for select biotech entrants.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Alternative Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin and Ethereum: Market expects further gains, with notable chance for Bitcoin above $130,000 and Ethereum above $6,000 by Dec 2025. Major downside moves (to $50,000/$1,000) seen as very low probability.</li>
<li>New crypto ETFs (Ripple, Dogecoin) poised for regulatory approval, suggesting broadening institutional recognition and potential for flows/diversification.</li>
<li>US Treasury exploring blockchain; should such innovation materialize, second-order effect is acceleration of digital asset legitimacy and infrastructure investment themes.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Indices &amp; Major Names</h2>
<h3>Equities Indices</h3>
<ul>
<li>S&amp;P 500: Majority consensus expects the index to end 2025 between ~6,400 and 6,800, betting on structural earnings strength in tech and industrials, but upside capped by higher-for-longer rates and macro/policy crosswinds.</li>
<li>Nasdaq-100: Positioned for stronger relative outperformance, reflecting continued dominance by mega-cap tech and semis.</li>
<li>&quot;Magnificent 7&quot; expected to retain outsized index share; market breadth concerns remain, but little sign of rotation away from largest names.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Leading Companies</h3>
<ul>
<li>NVIDIA is the clear favorite to remain world’s largest by market cap through year-end, with substantial momentum from AI and semis.</li>
<li>Microsoft and Apple trail, with little probability of retaking top spot this year; risk of further valuation compression at Apple if B2C device growth slows.</li>
<li>Amazon unlikely to challenge for largest market cap position in 2025.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Watchlist: 2nd/3rd Order Effects &amp; Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li>US tech labor shakeout = higher cash flow/margin for survivors, but watch for AI-driven productivity or offshoring pressure.</li>
<li>Federal action against renewables (offshore wind halt) may prompt political &amp; utility sector volatility—watch for red-state/blue-state grid investment divergence, higher regulatory risk premiums.</li>
<li>Trade/tariff enforcement on small shipments: logistical snarls and cost volatility for import-reliant US retailers and e-commerce, also impacting global shipping firms.</li>
<li>Wildfire and climate: California/Napa events are reminder of growing insurance/property risk trends and possible municipal bond spread volatility.</li>
<li>Secondary repercussions from high US debt could be felt in longer-term risk premiums on Treasuries, with spillovers into mortgage rates and cap markets—especially if markets focus on debt ceiling or shutdown events.</li>
<li>Elevated crypto optimism can stoke risk appetite, but bubbles/volatility remain elevated, particularly if regulatory timeline slips.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p><strong>Actionables:</strong><br />
Remain positioned for US resilience, focus on AI/semis, watch for inflection points if energy/crypto/defense volatility spikes. Renewables/utilities and rate-sensitive areas at higher risk as policy momentum shifts. Keep an eye on fiscal headlines, especially debt ceiling or government shutdown risk periods, for volatility spikes.</p>
