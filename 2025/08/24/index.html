<h2>I. Macro &amp; Policy Outlook</h2>
<h3>Economy &amp; Markets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growth:</strong> US GDP is on a slow-growth trajectory for 2025, with most expectations landing between 1-2.5%. Risks of outright recession remain low, but any downside surprise (e.g., negative Q3 GDP) would be notable for equities.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Headline and core inflation look set to remain above 3%, with upside risks persisting rather than diminishing. Expect both CPI and core measures to stay meaningfully above target, keeping real yields relevant.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market:</strong> Tech layoff activity is expected to outpace last year. Unemployment could drift into the mid-4% range by September, but a sharp jobs downturn is unlikely based on current indicators. Wage growth may run a bit above inflation, supporting consumption but also limiting Fed rate cuts.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal &amp; Deficit:</strong> Little prospect of sharp US government spending cuts before 2027; deficit likely to increase, and US debt levels will remain elevated. Risk of shutdown in 2025 is notable but not base case.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rates &amp; Federal Reserve</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interest Rate Path:</strong> At most one or two modest rate cuts anticipated in 2025; scenario for persistent high rates (or additional hikes) has virtually disappeared.</li>
<li><strong>Bond Market:</strong> 10-year Treasury yield could challenge 4.6% on any inflation/deficit scare, but much higher rates seem unlikely in the near-term. Yields at 5% or above are not anticipated.</li>
<li><strong>Policy Risks:</strong> Very low likelihood of radical moves (Fed abolition/end, emergency cuts/hikes), but policy uncertainty is running higher into 2026 elections.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inflation Protection &amp; USD</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stagflation/Default:</strong> Neither US stagflation nor outright default are likely in 2025. However, persistent high inflation warrants TIPS/short-duration inflation-hedged exposure, especially vs. nominal long bonds.</li>
<li><strong>De-dollarization:</strong> USD index risk remains skewed to the downside for the year, but extreme moves unlikely; watch for spillover into commodities if dollar softens.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>II. Sector &amp; Thematic Views</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI / Semiconductors:</strong> US semiconductor output is expected to continue strong double-digit growth; ongoing investment in AI infrastructure (Meta, Oracle, Nvidia) and new product cycles will anchor tech leadership. Hype and risks of market froth (per OpenAI’s warnings) are growing, especially for companies riding the most speculative narratives.</li>
<li><strong>Layoffs:</strong> Persistent layoffs in tech indicate productivity/cost focuses may lead to better long-term margins, but intermediate pressure on commercial real estate and tech labor markets may emerge.</li>
<li><strong>M&amp;A &amp; IPOs:</strong> Few major US tech IPOs expected through 2026; Stripe and Starlink acceleration possible closer to 2027. Fintech IPO pipeline is especially thin, with Stripe and Klarna discussed but not imminent.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil &amp; Gas:</strong> Oil price expectations remain highly volatile, with increased likelihood of sharp drops (below $65/barrel possible), but upside spikes ($85+/barrel) still plausible depending on geopolitical events.</li>
<li><strong>Natural Gas:</strong> High price levels expected to persist into 2025, supporting energy sector profit pools, especially if weather- or war-driven demand spikes occur.</li>
<li><strong>Renewables/Utilities:</strong> US solar installations likely to grow steadily, though not at record rates—sector outlook remains constructive, helped by grid/infrastructure spending drivers (Meta, Entergy, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Nuclear:</strong> No imminent prospect of new US nuclear licenses, but sector tailwinds exist from energy transition dialogue.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>GLP-1/Obesity Pipeline:</strong> Despite recent setbacks, growth remains robust and sector winners persistent; expect market volatility around incremental trial data/approvals, but secular trend toward widespread medical weight-management continues.</li>
<li><strong>Policy risks:</strong> Ongoing vaccine controversies may affect sentiment around healthcare service and insurance equities.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Management:</strong> BlackRock and peers will emphasize digital assets, private-market growth, and continued ETF inflows. Margin pressure and regulatory reform will be monitored, with frequent mentions of record AUM (assets under management).</li>
<li><strong>Banking:</strong> Leadership changes possible at JP Morgan; broader bank sector stability is not in question, but ongoing adaptation to high-for-longer rates will pressure net interest margins.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Media &amp; Consumer</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Streaming:</strong> Netflix and related platforms will continue to push price increases, but consumer demand for top content and international titles remains strong.</li>
<li><strong>Retail &amp; Consumer:</strong> Wage growth slightly exceeding inflation is likely to prop up near-term discretionary spending.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>III. Company-Specific/Asset Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> IPO not imminent; headline/news flow swings risk. Potential upcoming product hardware with Jony Ive in 2025. High likelihood of new browser product launch.</li>
<li><strong>Meta:</strong> Aggressive AI/datacenter investments; expect regulatory/supply chain/utility headlines.</li>
<li><strong>Nvidia:</strong> Will focus upcoming earnings on sovereign AI, robotics, new chip classes (Blackwell, Hopper). China risks/enterprise datacenter business a strong theme.</li>
<li><strong>Oracle:</strong> Earnings will feature multicloud, cloud backlog, capital expenditure, and continued AI momentum.</li>
<li><strong>Apple, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, Tesla:</strong> No CEO changes expected this year; Apple product cycle transitions (iPhone 17, foldable rumors) remain slow-burn themes. Microsoft’s path to &quot;largest company&quot; status not assured.</li>
<li><strong>Stripe/Klarna/Rippling:</strong> Unlikely to IPO imminently; sector focus may shift to profitability over new listings.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong> Continued hype around major crypto ETFs (Ripple, Doge, Cardano, Litecoin) and run-up in BTC/ETH prices; minimal concern about Tether/USDT stability in 2025. Extreme price targets for BTC are not expected soon.</li>
<li><strong>Defense/Geopolitics:</strong> Military events in Israel-Hamas-Yemen and Ukraine-Russia will maintain support for defense sector, risk premium across oil/gas.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>IV. Watch List: Triggers &amp; Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li>Labor market softening beyond expectation (esp. tech) or sharp uptick in unemployment.</li>
<li>Sharp CPI/inflation upside or global supply chain hiccups (e.g., tariffs, logistics, postal suspensions).</li>
<li>Major escalation in Middle East, Ukraine, or US domestic policy gridlock.</li>
<li>Further capital spending or AI/semiconductor demand surges.</li>
<li>Climate and natural disaster events, notably hurricanes, heatwaves, or abrupt Antarctic developments.</li>
<li>Surprises in bond yield spikes (esp. 10yr UST), Fed surprise, or government shutdown risk.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br />
The economic backdrop is steady but not exciting; inflation stays sticky, and rate relief is slow. Growth is tepid, not recessionary. Stay constructive but hedged on quality US equities (esp. tech/AI/semis), remain underweight long-duration bonds unless inflation hedged, and watch energy/commodity pivots. Political and climate risks are gathering but not base case triggers for market collapse—stability persists, with intermittent volatility.</p>
