<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Policy</h2>
<h3>1. Geopolitical Risk: Russia/Ukraine &amp; US/Europe</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing US-EU support for Ukraine exists against backdrop of Trump’s overtures to Putin, hinting at a possible long, drawn-out path toward any Western-favored Ukraine deal.</li>
<li>The lack of immediate ceasefire and risk of shifting US priorities could further destabilize energy and grain markets, keep global defense spending stable or higher, and slow European industrial recovery.</li>
<li>Any sign US aid may wane (especially after possible Trump victory) is likely to further price in stronger dollar versus euro and possibly push up energy and food prices, benefiting US defense and energy exporters in the short-to-intermediate term.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. US Domestic Stability: Political Heat &amp; Redistricting</h3>
<ul>
<li>National Guard deployment to DC and redistricting battles signal increasing civil-political strife ahead of the 2026 midterm and possible impact on federal budget negotiations, especially around security and entitlement spending.</li>
<li>Expect higher volatility in risk assets if there are additional protests or confrontations, particularly in sectors dependent on Federal funding, security, or infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Federal Reserve &amp; Inflation Watch</h3>
<ul>
<li>Anticipation of a hawkish Jackson Hole statement from Powell suggests bonds could see yields pop further, putting renewed pressure on rate-sensitive assets, real estate, and growth equities.</li>
<li>The narrative around resilient economic data and sticky inflation may re-anchor the “higher for longer” regime, favoring value over growth, reinforcing strength in commodities, financials, and dollar-exposed sectors.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Views</h2>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing Ukraine uncertainty, combined with hurricane threats to US Gulf infrastructure, supports short-term bullishness on energy and agricultural commodities, especially if logistical disruptions arise.</li>
<li>Extended unrest in the Mideast (Gaza, Israel) keeps a floor under oil prices due to supply anxiety.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Defense &amp; Aerospace</h3>
<ul>
<li>Delays in a Ukraine settlement and robust NATO solidarity drive steady demand for US/EU defense suppliers.</li>
<li>Tensions in Congress over military aid could cause sector swings; expect spikes on hints of increased spending, and dips if US aid appears truly exhausted.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tech &amp; Telecom</h3>
<ul>
<li>Renewed labor disputes (Air Canada) and rapid AI-induced workforce shifts highlight risks and opportunities: broad tech continues to benefit from cost-cutting efficiency tails, but adoption gaps can create losers among legacy-heavy incumbents.</li>
<li>Samsung outpacing Apple in US market share underscores consumer demand for innovation (foldables, AR glasses), a potential negative read for Apple if unable to respond swiftly.</li>
<li>Elevated cyber risk (AI-driven phishing, Gmail hacks) remains a tailwind for cybersecurity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Estate</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fed hawkishness and sticky inflation keeps upward pressure on rates, bearish for commercial and residential REITs; data center REITs may outperform as AI/data infrastructure boom persists (but with new local resistance risks).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Travel &amp; Consumer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing air travel labor unrest exposes weaknesses in international travel recovery and could drive cost inflation for consumers. Premium/luxury consumer spending faces pressure from higher credit card costs.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company &amp; Theme Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meta &amp; Samsung:</strong> Both making strong AR/foldables hardware pushes; positive sentiment for suppliers and ecosystem players tied to new hardware cycles.</li>
<li><strong>Apple:</strong> Potential near-term weakness due to falling US market share and perceived lack of device innovation.</li>
<li><strong>Defense Majors (Lockheed, Northrop, RTX, etc.):</strong> Supported by durable Ukraine/NATO tailwinds, but risk from US policy “whipsaw” if new administration deprioritizes foreign military aid.</li>
<li><strong>Travel/Airlines (Air Canada, US peers):</strong> Vulnerable to labor actions and wage inflation; anticipate broader labor push for AI/automation “protection” as sector theme.</li>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity (Crowdstrike, Palo Alto, etc.):</strong> Tailwinds due to ongoing wave of large-scale AI/cyber attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Data Centers &amp; Infrastructure:</strong> Data/AI expansion bullish for operators but local opposition (water/power usage) could threaten future expansion; regulatory risk on horizon.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Second-Order &amp; Long-Term Signals</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>US political stress</strong> may lead to policy unpredictability impacting everything from tariffs to tech regulation and healthcare spending.</li>
<li><strong>Climate/weather risk</strong> (hurricanes, wildfires) could mean higher insurance costs, intermittent supply chain shocks, and reinforce the policy case for more resilient infrastructure and localized sourcing.</li>
<li><strong>AI adoption pace</strong>: Swiftest movers in corporate America are widening their margins via headcount reduction; hesitant industries (and regions) risk productivity gaps and equity underperformance.</li>
<li><strong>Social unrest and global protest activity</strong> (Israel, US cities) raise tail-risk profile for unpredictable announcements/legislation.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Stay alert to breaking developments around Jackson Hole (Friday), further unrest in DC and Israel, and any new labor disruptions, as these will set the tone for short-term market direction and volatility.</h3>
