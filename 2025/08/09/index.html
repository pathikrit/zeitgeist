<h2>Macro &amp; Global</h2>
<h3>US Economy &amp; Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interest Rates</strong>: Expectations for US rates to remain elevated through 2025, with consensus around several modest cuts (most likely 2-3) over the next 12 months, well short of a rapid normalization. Risk of an emergency rate move or surprise hike remains low.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation</strong>: Inflation likely to persist above target (~3%), with little risk of either deflation or severe stagflation. Both core and headline inflation figures remain moderately elevated but contained. Prospects for a serious inflation spike (&gt;5%) are low.</li>
<li><strong>Government Spending &amp; Debt</strong>: Strong likelihood of continued deficit spending; US national debt surpassing $38T this year appears almost certain, with direct implications for future rate and fiscal policy.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market</strong>: Unemployment is showing gradual upward pressure, but at a controlled pace. Risks of a spike into double digits are viewed as low. Monthly jobs growth likely to moderate but remain positive in the near-term.</li>
<li><strong>GDP &amp; Market Outlook</strong>: Recession risk for 2025 remains moderate-to-low, but not zero—market sentiment is poised for sluggish to modest positive GDP growth. Equities are expected to finish the year higher, with the S&amp;P 500 skewed toward upper ranges (6,400+), but corrections (down to 5,100 or so) remain possible in volatile periods.</li>
<li><strong>Government Shutdowns</strong>: Material risk of short-term government shutdowns remains, with fiscal and debt ceiling fights unresolved.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US–Russia–Ukraine</strong>: Immediate event risk around Trump-Putin Alaska meeting, with possible movement towards a ceasefire or de facto acceptance of Russian gains in Ukraine. Could impact global energy markets, European security, and defense spending.</li>
<li><strong>US–China–Trade</strong>: Continued tensions over tariffs, with a possible focus shift towards Switzerland but persistent threat of broader trade wars.</li>
<li><strong>Middle East</strong>: Israeli-Gaza and hostages situation remains volatile. US policy ambiguity, growing international criticism—heightened geopolitical premium on energy and defense assets.</li>
<li><strong>Emerging Markets</strong>: Peso and real (Mexico, Brazil) show pronounced vulnerability to further devaluation; EM FX risk remains tail-heavy.</li>
<li><strong>Nuclear Risk</strong>: Renewed nuclear anxiety (Nagasaki anniversary, Ukraine) may increase the risk premium on tail-risk hedges.</li>
<li><strong>Migration &amp; Domestic Policy</strong>: US policy on border security, immigration, and enforcement becoming more aggressive. Short-term disruptions possible in labor markets and select sectors (e.g., agriculture, construction).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Currencies, Commodities, and Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>USD</strong>: Dollar Index likely to hit yearly lows, with plausible downside against major and emerging market currencies.</li>
<li><strong>Oil/Nat Gas</strong>: Extreme volatility, with oil trading in broad range ($50–$90). Geopolitical disruptions and ongoing US policy debates can trigger sharp moves. Natural gas expected to remain expensive.</li>
<li><strong>Gold/Swiss Imports</strong>: New tariffs disrupt global gold trade, benefit local warehousing/alternative reserves, hit Swiss luxury sector.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto</strong>: Sharp upward moves triggered by regulatory developments—Trump's support for crypto in retirement accounts creates a new bullish US demand pipeline.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Asset Classes</h2>
<h3>Equities – Broad and Sectoral</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tech</strong>: Continued sectoral strength, with semis/AI (NVIDIA, Oracle) dominating growth narratives and market cap leadership. Tech layoffs are probable but not at recessionary scale.</li>
<li><strong>Energy</strong>: A tug-of-war between softening demand (modest US growth) and geopolitical flare-ups. Solar install growth remains solid, but not at explosive levels. Nat gas price risk skewed upward.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare &amp; Biotech</strong>: HHS mRNA contract cuts undermine momentum for vaccine developers, but may marginally benefit traditional pharma and cost-focused healthcare providers. COVID variant surges could drive short-term demand for healthcare services.</li>
<li><strong>Defense</strong>: Ongoing demand tailwinds as policy uncertainty and risks (Ukraine, Middle East, nuclear) remain high-profile.</li>
<li><strong>Real Estate (REITs)</strong>: Rents rising in key urban markets like New York (+6%) and San Francisco (~2%). Inflation and policy backdrop remain moderately supportive for real asset classes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Credit &amp; Bonds</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Treasuries</strong>: No expectation of a rate hike; moderate rate cut path through 2025. High debt and fiscal spending are likely to underpin yield curve steepness and keep term premium elevated. Treasury credit downgrade risk is moderate, outright default very low.</li>
<li><strong>Credit Risk</strong>: Systemic worries low; only minor risk to Tether (USDT) peg or insolvency. Market circuit breaker or major market distress seen as unlikely near-term.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Alternatives &amp; Crypto</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crypto</strong>: Regulatory green lights and bullish policy signals (e.g., 401(k) access) may drive large cap crypto (Bitcoin, ETH) toward all-time highs. Extreme upside (parabolic moves) remains unlikely but not impossible. Volatility risk persists—but medium-term trajectory points upward.</li>
<li><strong>Commodities</strong>: The inflation/reserve hedge thesis is supported by rising tariffs, renewed nuclear and war anxiety, and currency volatility.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company &amp; Thematic Watchlist</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>NVIDIA</strong>: Increasing likelihood to remain the world’s most valuable company, driven by secular AI and datacenter growth. Watch for product cycle themes (Blackwell, Hopper, automation).</li>
<li><strong>Oracle</strong>: Focus on SaaS, multicloud, and performance obligations; watch AI partnership headlines and new cloud initiatives.</li>
<li><strong>BlackRock</strong>: Continued revenue, AUM, and digital/ETF growth. Private market activity and Aladdin platform headlines to watch.</li>
<li><strong>Apple/Microsoft/Alphabet/Tesla</strong>: Short-term leadership shifts possible in tech mega-cap space, but no expectation Apple or Alphabet will unseat current leader. Tesla faces little short-term risk to Musk’s net worth/top company status.</li>
<li><strong>SpaceX</strong>: Poised for record launch cadence, potential supply chain and downstream aerospace impacts.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Key Second/Third Order Effects</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>US crypto policy</strong> can attract global institutional AUM, alter the US private equity and retirement investing landscape, and create new demand for regulated onshore crypto custody/ETF platforms.</li>
<li><strong>The Trump-Putin Alaska summit</strong> may cement a new status quo in Ukraine, reducing direct energy/commodity shock risk but undermining defense spending stability in Europe and select US sectors.</li>
<li><strong>HHS mRNA contract cancellation</strong> weakens US pandemic readiness, could force margin compression or pivots among biotech firms, and flip funding/returns outlook for pandemic-specific subsectors.</li>
<li><strong>Persistent fiscal loosening</strong> keeps a floor under real asset valuations, underwrites continued demand for inflation-hedged sectors, and pressures both Treasury yields and the USD.</li>
<li><strong>Gold/Swiss tariff drama</strong> could boost US-based warehousing, fintech gold platforms, and local jewelry/luxury alternatives at the expense of global/Swiss trade.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Tactical Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Maintain core risk exposure to large-cap US equities and tech/AI/semiconductor leadership.</li>
<li>Consider tactical overweights in defense, energy, and real assets (REITs, commodities) as persistent policy, inflation, and geopolitical volatility continue.</li>
<li>Watch for structural openings in crypto (ETFs, custody, US-based institutional flows).</li>
<li>Monitor urban real estate for further rent spikes, especially in key metros.</li>
<li>Beware of currency shocks in LATAM and policy-driven volatility in European/Russian/Chinese markets.</li>
</ul>
