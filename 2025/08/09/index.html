<li><strong>Natural Disasters</strong>: Fires prompt evacuations in California; ongoing brush fire containment efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Macro Themes</strong>: Tariffs and trade remain at the forefront of US policy; strong possibility for new or enhanced US tariffs against major trade partners.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Geopolitical Landscape</h2>
<h3>1. US Macro, Inflation, and Interest Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Growth</strong>: Growth for 2025 expected to be subdued, clustering around 1.1–2.5%, with low odds of either recession or a growth boom.</li>
<li><strong>Unemployment</strong>: Odds tilt toward a gradual uptick in unemployment, likely exceeding 4% by August, with a potential rise to 6–8% by decade’s end, suggesting continued labor market softening.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation</strong>: Both headline and core inflation expected to be slightly above target (2.5–3.5% common estimates), remaining persistent into late 2025. Little risk seen of runaway inflation or rapid disinflation.</li>
<li><strong>Fed Direction</strong>: Low probability of rate hikes this year and limited likelihood of aggressive rate cuts; policy likely to remain steady or see at most 1–2 cuts, underscoring a “higher-for-longer” stance.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Outlook</strong>: Government spending continues at elevated levels, with the national debt very likely to surpass $38T by year-end.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Implications for Investors</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Rates are expected to plateau, with little cost-of-capital relief.</li>
<li>Sticky inflation and tepid job growth could limit consumer strength; defensive positioning in equities may be warranted.</li>
<li>Persistent fiscal deficits and high debt make US Treasuries sensitive to both rate/inflation surprises and political events.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Geopolitics and Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ukraine &amp; Russia</strong>: Ceasefire talk is real, but a durable solution is elusive; the likelihood of renewed volatility in energy/defense sectors remains.</li>
<li><strong>US Trade Policy</strong>: Tariff actions remain highly probable, targeting China, South Korea, Japan, Mexico, Taiwan, and the EU. Additional measures on copper, semiconductors, and pharma are on the table.</li>
<li><strong>Global Stability</strong>: While risks of a major EU country exiting the bloc remain modest, medium-term fracturing or populist pressures shouldn't be discounted.</li>
<li><strong>US Domestic Stability</strong>: Political gridlock and institutional strain continue, with potential policy volatility on healthcare, food assistance (SNAP), and union-related labor law.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Themes</h2>
<h3>1. Technology, AI, &amp; Cloud</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI &amp; Cloud Leadership</strong>: Nvidia likely to become (and remain) the world’s largest company by year-end, reflecting continued dominance in AI hardware, robotics, datacenter, and inference markets. Oracle expected to emphasize strong cloud business and remaining performance obligations in its guidance.</li>
<li><strong>Antitrust Pressure</strong>: High chances that Apple and Amazon will be deemed monopolies by courts before 2030; scrutiny on Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla could intensify via upcoming regulatory or FTC actions.</li>
<li><strong>IPO Market</strong>: Klarna is the next likely major IPO, with Stripe farther out. Discord could move before 2026; OpenAI/Anthropic IPOs remain longer-term prospects.</li>
<li><strong>Layoffs &amp; Labor</strong>: Tech layoffs are increasing year-on-year as companies recalibrate post-AI-hype growth rates.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Second-Order Effects</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing AI and cloud capex cycles may pressure margins for the broader tech ecosystem.</li>
<li>Antitrust actions could restrain M&amp;A and strategic moves by big tech, while encouraging innovation and opportunities for smaller players.</li>
<li>Higher global tariffs may disrupt tech supply chains, especially for semiconductors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Energy, Resources, &amp; Renewables</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy Mix</strong>: While renewables—particularly solar—are growing, traditional sources (coal, oil, and gas) still dominate through the decade. Policy and cost inflation may further delay transitions.</li>
<li><strong>Price Dynamics</strong>: Oil and natural gas prices likely to oscillate, but not collapse; geopolitical risks (including those around Ukraine and the Middle East) could rapidly move prices.</li>
<li><strong>Tariffs on Commodities</strong>: US is set to impose new tariffs, especially on copper and semiconductors—potential for increased volatility, margin compression among industrial manufacturers, and global supply chain shakeups.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Healthcare &amp; Biotech</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Policy Turbulence</strong>: Hints of policy revisions (including SNAP cuts, Obamacare repeal attempts) could stress some subsectors, while anticipated FDA approvals (e.g., new rare disease drugs and psychedelic treatments) create speculative opportunities in biotech.</li>
<li><strong>Biotech Upside</strong>: Type 1 diabetes cure before 2033 remains a moonshot, while more incremental progress (and associated volatility around FDA catalysts) can be expected.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Crypto &amp; Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mainstreaming Crypto</strong>: Regulatory clarity is improving; market structure regulation is likely this year. Large cap stablecoins may yet see regulatory approval, but depegging risk remains for some. Speculation about BTC (and possibly ETH) reserve purchases by the US persists.</li>
<li><strong>Retirement Plans &amp; Crypto</strong>: Policy momentum to allow crypto and private equity within 401(k)s could unlock new inflows and volatility for both asset classes.</li>
<li><strong>Price Action</strong>: High expectations for continued upside in flagship cryptos—BTC, ETH, and XRP show leadership potential—but sharp downward corrections remain possible.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Names &amp; Noteworthy Cases</h2>
<h3>Megacap Tech</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia (NVDA)</strong>: Market leadership sustained by relentless AI/driven demand from cloud, gaming, and enterprise. Watch for further expansion into robotics and “sovereign” computing.</li>
<li><strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong>: Ongoing software updates and product refreshes. Regulatory concerns rising (antitrust).</li>
<li><strong>Alphabet (GOOGL)</strong>: Stable leadership; ongoing regulatory risk, especially in AI search monetization and EU/US scrutiny.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon (AMZN)</strong>: Antitrust risk rising; regulatory outcome could impact margin structure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>AI / Cloud</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oracle (ORCL)</strong>: Positive momentum expected in cloud and SaaS, with focus on backlog and new platform partnerships.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI / Anthropic</strong>: Near-term IPO unlikely, but OpenAI remains the most visible private AI company. Sam Altman’s leadership remains steady for now.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consumer, Media, Other</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Live Nation</strong>: Facing increased legal and regulatory risks over monopoly status.</li>
<li><strong>Klarna, Stripe, Discord</strong>: Market is watching closely for IPO signals. Klarna is the likely leader.</li>
<li><strong>FaZe Media</strong>: Executive search volatility can impact sentiment in the gaming/media niche.</li>
<li><strong>Pharma</strong>: Multiple specialty drugs nearing FDA approval stand out as near-term speculative plays.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commodities, Crypto, and Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>WTI Oil</strong>: Moderate downside risk, but price collapses remain unlikely absent severe demand shocks.</li>
<li><strong>BTC, ETH, XRP</strong>: Remain focal points of institutional adoption and policy “national reserve” speculation; volatility likely high on both upside and downside.</li>
<li><strong>Stablecoins (Tether, USDC)</strong>: Tail risk of regulatory surprises and depegging persists, but structural adoption remains cautiously positive.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Actionables / Monitoring Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Track upcoming regulatory and judicial actions against Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and other Big Tech names for near-term headline risk.</li>
<li>Prepare for renewed volatility if Trump makes decisive moves on tariffs or crypto policy, especially affecting semiconductors, pharma, and popular imports/exports.</li>
<li>Watch energy and commodity names for second-order effects of ongoing geopolitical risk (Ukraine, Middle East, Asian supply chains).</li>
<li>Stay alert for COVID and new health threat headline risk; monitor for policy responses with potential to disrupt labor markets and consumption patterns.</li>
<li>Monitor US fiscal positioning, national debt trajectory, and market response to ongoing elevated government spending.</li>
</ul>
