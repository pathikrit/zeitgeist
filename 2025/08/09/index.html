<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Economic Themes</h2>
<h3>US Growth, Inflation, and Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outlook:</strong> The prevailing view is moderate US GDP growth in 2025, with growth rates likely in the ~1-2.5% range, and little sentiment for contraction.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Sustained, slightly elevated inflation remains the consensus, with 2025 likely to see CPI and core inflation sticking near/slightly above 3%. The risk of re-acceleration into the 5-6% range is low but not negligible.
<ul>
<li><strong>Second Order:</strong> Persistent inflation above target implies the Fed is unlikely to pursue aggressive rate cuts, preserving a relatively restrictive environment and limiting multiple expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market:</strong> There is broad expectation of unemployment softening through 2025, but spikes into double digits remain remote risks. Technology sector layoffs are expected to outpace 2024, suggesting ongoing churn despite overall resilience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Federal Reserve:</strong> Multiple rate cuts are not expected; base case is for one or two at most, and a hike appears off the table unless a sharp growth/inflation shock emerges.</li>
<li><strong>US Debt:</strong> A new high for national debt is nearly certain, materially breaching $38 trillion. Concerns over long-term sustainability grow, but the probability of a US default or market circuit breaker being triggered remains very low.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Economic Picture</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recessions:</strong> Elevated risk of recession in major developed economies outside the US (Japan, UK, Germany especially), with China and India seen as more resilient in the near term.</li>
<li><strong>US Trade Deficit:</strong> Potential halving of the trade deficit is plausible under current US policy, especially if tariffs and protectionism rise, with significant tailwinds for selected domestic sectors.</li>
<li><strong>US Dollar &amp; Sovereign Risk:</strong> No acute US dollar crisis or risk-off event signaled, but the steady accumulation of federal debt and global trade frictions will be increasingly scrutinized by rates and FX markets.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Thematic Implications</h2>
<h3>Equities &amp; Indices</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Broad US Markets:</strong> Despite macro headwinds, a positive year for large US indices remains the base case. However, upside is capped; a major surge seems less likely than a grind higher with periodic volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Tech Sector:</strong> Tech indices will face weight from fresh layoffs and a lack of clear mega-cap upside catalysts. Leadership concentration in the ‘Magnificent 7’ will likely persist. AI remains highly topical, with regulatory risk rising as new legislation seems increasingly plausible.</li>
<li><strong>Media and Entertainment:</strong> Paramount’s merger with Skydance exemplifies ongoing media consolidation and a focus on streaming and AI partnerships.</li>
<li><strong>Financial Sector:</strong> 401(k) reforms expanding access to crypto and private equity could drive new retail flows and product development (second order: watch for new ETF product launches and potential systemic risk review).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commodities, Energy &amp; Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gold:</strong> Bullion prices are volatile amid mixed signals on tariffs and global risk appetite. If inflation persists or geopolitical shocks escalate, gold continues to be well-supported.</li>
<li><strong>Energy:</strong> Germany’s freeze on arms to Israel speaks to increasing European and global sensitivity to Mideast instability—potential impact on crude, defense, and related supply chains.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong> Legal clarity post-XRP case removes a big overhang for crypto markets, setting the stage for further institutionalization and product development. Risk of a USDT depeg remains a known (but currently low-probability) systemic risk.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Health, Biotech &amp; Public Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>COVID/Health:</strong> New COVID variants and growing infectious disease outbreaks (chikungunya/Legionnaires) are a reminder that biotech and public health policy risk can resurface quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Vaccine Policy:</strong> With government cutting mRNA vaccine support, watch for impacts on biotech equities reliant on public procurement or regulatory certainty.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitical &amp; Event Risk</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>US–Russia–Ukraine:</strong> Next week’s Trump-Putin summit in Alaska offers a rare window for a negotiated pause in Ukraine’s war. Any moves towards US recognition of Russian claims could trigger market volatility, especially in commodities and defense.</li>
<li><strong>Middle East:</strong> Increased arms-trade restrictions (Germany halting exports to Israel), humanitarian concern in Gaza, and unstable Israel policy may indirectly support energy and defense sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Asia:</strong> No imminent recognition shift for Taiwan, though the topic’s discussion alone reflects ongoing risks to semiconductors and supply chains.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company-specific &amp; Micro Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tesla:</strong> Ongoing legal/arsonist risk remains a non-negligible, idiosyncratic headline risk for the auto sector.</li>
<li><strong>Apple:</strong> Unlikely to launch a new foldable iPhone this year, implying near-term innovation headlines may be muted.</li>
<li><strong>Paramount:</strong> Skydance merger completed—expect business model changes focused on streaming and AI-driven content distribution.</li>
<li><strong>Ripple/XRP:</strong> Resolution of legal overhang—follows with new institutional fundraising rounds and potential for further rapid sector moves.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Key Focuses for Investors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stay alert to headline shocks around the Trump-Putin Alaska summit and related moves in commodities, defense, and EM assets.</li>
<li>Continue to monitor inflation data and the employment outlook; persistent core inflation above target likely keeps the Fed cautious.</li>
<li>Consider increasing attention to alternative asset opportunities in retirement vehicles, as DC plan reforms may unlock flows into crypto, private credit, and previously untapped markets.</li>
<li>Maintain broad economic exposure, but be mindful of global recession risk, especially in European and Japanese markets.</li>
<li>Geopolitics and public health remain prominent sources of tail risk; second-order impacts (supply chain, insurance losses, travel/tourism) can create both opportunities and shocks.</li>
</ul>
