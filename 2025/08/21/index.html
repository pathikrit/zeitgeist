</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro / Interest Rates / Policy</h2>
<p><strong>US GDP &amp; Inflation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The market expects moderate, not exceptional, US GDP growth for the rest of the year and 2025, likely in the 1.5–2.5% range.</li>
<li>Inflation is seen gradually easing but not returning fully to pre-pandemic lows; core and headline CPI mostly projected above 2.5%.</li>
<li>With both GDP and inflation likely remaining within these “soft landing” bounds, extreme outcomes are considered improbable, but persistent 2nd-order inflation pressure remains.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fed Policy Outlook</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No hikes expected in 2025; potential for one or two moderate rate cuts, but no rapid cuts or an outright easing cycle looks likely unless the economy deteriorates sharply.</li>
<li>Rates are projected to remain meaningfully above 3% through 2026. This environment supports a generally restrictive policy, suggesting short-duration and floating-rate bonds may outperform long-duration Treasuries until real softening appears.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fiscal Position</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>US national debt is expected to keep rising, surpassing $38T by year’s end. This persistent supply will pressure intermediate and long-term rates, but crowding out effects for equities are not acute with moderating inflation and stable policy.</li>
<li>The continued deficit spending may limit the Fed’s flexibility and keep upward pressure on yields; this retards any case for strong rallies in duration-heavy fixed income.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Labor Market &amp; Wages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Despite persistent job growth, a high probability exists for further tech layoffs this year. The labor market is likely to rebalance, with wage gains modestly ahead of inflation but employment gains slowing.</li>
<li>Unemployment is expected to drift higher (into the low/mid 4% range), but not spike.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Implications</h2>
<p><strong>Technology &amp; AI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tech, particularly AI, is undergoing significant volatility and a correction. The selloff shows that multiples were stretched, and leadership is passing to only a few mega-cap AI developers (Google, xAI, Meta), with Nvidia losing “#1 AI” model leadership status in perception.</li>
<li>Growth in US semiconductor production remains strong. US-focused semiconductor manufacturers have fundamental tailwinds, but the sector is bifurcated: AI infrastructure spending and core chip demand are strong, but front-end cloud and speculative AI names are being repriced.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Retail / Consumer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Big box retail (Walmart) faces ongoing margin compression from both trade policy (tariffs) and consumer spending shifts.</li>
<li>Continued wage gains and low unemployment will support broad consumer demand, but discretionary spending is sensitive to higher interest rates and softening confidence.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Healthcare</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Significant increase in public health crises (whooping cough, potential polio, plague case) may create incremental demand for vaccines and diagnostics.</li>
<li>mRNA technology and pediatric vaccines are politically in focus, but no near-term legislative threats to sector revenue expected.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Energy &amp; Commodities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Oil price projections are bifurcated: downside risks are prominent for WTI (higher odds of sub-$65 than above $90) as supply remains robust and demand does not surge; US oil production is not expected to make new highs.</li>
<li>Natural gas prices are projected to surge above $4, favoring US producers and likely driving input costs in energy-intensive sectors.</li>
<li>Solar buildout is strong but will likely undershoot ambitious targets; traditional energy is likely to remain more profitable near-term despite climate momentum.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Financials &amp; Rates Sensitive Sectors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No big rate moves are expected; banks and insurers comfortable with the current range. Mortgage and financing activity remains stable but not growing rapidly.</li>
<li>Crowd-out from US debt issuance could weigh on long-duration REITs and infrastructure, but risks of a forced unwind remain low with rates not spiking.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Asset Class Outlook</h2>
<p><strong>US Equities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The S&amp;P 500 is expected to finish the year positive, with upward momentum losing speed as tech corrects and “AI leaders” consolidate share. Large corrections below 5,000 considered unlikely, but annual returns could be hampered by rich valuations in growth segments.</li>
<li>The Nasdaq-100 outlook is directionally similar but faces sharper corrections in high-momentum names.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bonds</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Long-term Treasury and high-quality US debt will face price pressure from persistent deficits and “higher for longer” rates. Shorter duration and floating-rate instruments look relatively better.</li>
<li>No expectation of an emergency Fed cut or rapid hiking cycle.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Commodities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Energy price risk is skewed lower for oil (WTI), but higher for US natural gas.</li>
<li>Gold and inflation-protected securities are not under present threat, as crisis or runaway inflation scenarios are unlikely.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crypto</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Major run-ups in Bitcoin and Ethereum toward ultra-high milestones are considered improbable in the next 16 months; moderate upside scenarios for Ethereum ($5–6k is plausible), while Bitcoin return to previous peaks (~$130–150k) is possible but not base case.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitical &amp; Exogenous Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hurricane Erin</strong> and climate-driven catastrophe risks are rising, which could impact insurance, retail, construction, and regional infrastructure plays. Supply chain impacts (port/rail) possible in the near-term.</li>
<li>Middle East and Ukraine conflicts continue without resolution, keeping a risk premium baked into energy/defense and raising tail risk for broad market volatility.</li>
<li>US political environment remains unstable, with further gerrymandering and law enforcement crackdowns increasing uncertainty for fiscal and regulatory policy.</li>
<li>Ongoing public health outbreaks are not at major crisis level but highlight the need for resilience in health sector positioning.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Individual Companies / Names</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Walmart (WMT)</strong>: Missed profit estimates; faces margin pressure but benefits from stable baseline sales.</li>
<li><strong>Palantir (PLTR)</strong>: Extended drawdown amid AI tech correction; fundamental risk as “AI narrative” cools and project wins are needed to reverse sentiment.</li>
<li><strong>PlayStation/Sony</strong>: Hardware margin hit from tariffs—trade policy is now a meaningful filter for consumer hardware and electronics names.</li>
<li><strong>Google</strong>: Outpaces Apple in AI, is a clear leader alongside xAI and Meta, but the AI “bubble” is being pruned.</li>
<li><strong>Nvidia</strong>: While not the #1 “AI model” story, its role in the semiconductor supply chain secures earnings; valuation remains rich, but fundamental demand is healthy.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft</strong>: Ongoing software reliability issues emphasize cybersecurity and supply chain resilience as secondary themes.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Summary Thesis</h2>
<p>The economic outlook is a “soft landing” scenario with low risk of extreme moves in GDP or inflation. The Fed will likely maintain a restricted but not punitive policy, with only slight loosening. Sectors leveraged to AI and technology are seeing a repricing; leadership is narrowing. Energy transitions are underway, but traditional fossil fuels offer better near-term risk/reward than renewables. Geopolitical and policy risks are persistent but not (yet) crisis-level.</p>
<p>Stay diversified, prioritize quality in tech after correction, favor intermediate-duration bonds and floating-rate credit, and be mindful of exogenous/hurricane risk to physical asset plays and insurance. Avoid overexposure to extreme-growth narratives, but look for tactical positioning in health, selective energy, and strong balance-sheet tech.</p>
