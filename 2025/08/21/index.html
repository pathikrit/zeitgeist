<h2>Macro &amp; Policy</h2>
<h3>US Economic Outlook</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recession &amp; Growth</strong>
<ul>
<li>A recession beginning this year or in 2025 appears unlikely, with consensus favoring continued though moderate GDP growth (likely 1-2% range in 2025).</li>
<li>Wages are expected to outpace inflation this year, supporting continued consumer resilience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Inflation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Core inflation for 2025 remains stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% target, with base-case near 3-3.5%. This represents sticky inflation risk, potentially limiting the Fed's easing speed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Monetary Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fed Rate Path</strong>
<ul>
<li>There is strong consensus the Fed will not hike rates further in 2025 and a high likelihood of at least 1-2 rate cuts over the year, though deep or emergency cuts are seen as very unlikely.</li>
<li>The July 2025 Fed Funds rate is expected below 3.75%, suggesting easing but not a rapid pivot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Jackson Hole</strong>
<ul>
<li>Powell's speech tomorrow is a key event; any hawkish surprise or slower pace of rate cuts could extend equity and bond volatility.</li>
<li>Calls for Fed governor resignations (politically charged) and DOJ investigations may add perceived governance or independence risk, but are not yet systemic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal &amp; Credit Concerns</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Debt</strong>
<ul>
<li>US national debt will almost certainly breach $38T by year-end, but fears of &gt;130% debt/GDP this year appear exaggerated.</li>
<li>Chance of a US credit rating downgrade remains low, but not zero; headline risk persists, especially with periodic government shutdown threats (~1 in 3 odds).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Government Shutdown/Governance</strong>
<ul>
<li>Political gridlock (shutdowns, redistricting, “sanctuary city” clashes) continues, but the most disruptive scenarios are not base case. Short-term disruptions could still impact risk sentiment or delay fiscal legislation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Markets</h2>
<h3>Equities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>S&amp;P 500 / US Equities</strong>
<ul>
<li>Despite recent declines, the broad market is still expected to finish 2025 in positive territory.</li>
<li>Upside remains capped (high probability S&amp;P does not break above 7,500; moderate probability for &gt;6,700), but a deep selloff below 5,000 is not a central scenario.</li>
<li>Main risk factors: Fed communication missteps, geopolitical escalation (especially Russia/NATO/Ukraine or China/Taiwan topics).</li>
<li>Circuit breaker events (flash crashes) are still remote concerns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tariffs &amp; Materials</strong>
<ul>
<li>Trump administration is highly likely to introduce copper tariffs before 2026, raising costs across renewables/electrification supply chains and boosting US copper producer prospects.</li>
<li>Pharma tariff risk has receded due to US-EU deal, but could return if trade tensions escalate.</li>
<li>Rising gold as a 'fear' trade indicates hedging against both inflation stickiness and political/legal uncertainty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin/Ethereum</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sentiment around major crypto assets is bullish for moderate price appreciation through year-end (Bitcoin favored over $130,000, Ethereum likely above $5,000), but calls for extreme upside (e.g., $1M Bitcoin) remain pure tail risk.</li>
<li>Approval odds for new crypto ETFs (notably Ripple and Dogecoin) suggest further mainstreaming of digital assets, though the impact is more reputation than flow driven in the near term.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonds &amp; TIPS</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rates &amp; Credit</strong>
<ul>
<li>Longer durations likely see some price recovery as Fed eases, but sticky inflation and high debt levels cap any rally.</li>
<li>TIPS remain relevant for limited inflation protection; core inflation likely to hover well above 2% in 2025.</li>
<li>Low probability of a sudden rate spike or emergency cut; base case is for a mild, measured path.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Company Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Semiconductors</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nvidia has a strong likelihood of surpassing all public firms by year-end market cap, reflecting continued AI and chip sector dominance. Microsoft remains a plausible challenger; Apple and Tesla are very unlikely to reclaim the top spot soon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare</strong>
<ul>
<li>US-EU trade deal eases tariff pressure on pharmaceuticals, but ongoing scrutiny on pricing and periodic threats keep risk premium elevated, especially for firms heavily exposed to international trade.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Retail</strong>
<ul>
<li>Walmart results signal that input cost inflation (driven by tariffs) is eroding margins despite consumer demand holding up—watch for broader retail margin compression if tariffs continue ratcheting up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Aerospace &amp; Defense</strong>
<ul>
<li>SpaceX remains a key player in launches (likelihood of meeting high mission targets), reinforcing US leadership and supporting related supply chains in aerospace.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitics</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Russia-Ukraine/US Conflict</strong>
<ul>
<li>Russian strikes directly target US assets in Ukraine, underscoring potential for further escalation. Markets may grow sensitive to US supply chain, defense, or logistics companies with exposure to either conflict fallout or rearmament spending.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Middle East</strong>
<ul>
<li>Israel’s offensive and settlement expansion risk further destabilization, but direct market implications in the short run are limited outside security or energy sectors unless the conflict widens.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>China</strong>
<ul>
<li>Xi's reaffirmation of control in Tibet re-emphasizes China's internal stability concerns (read-through for supply chain resilience and risk management in industrials/tech sectors).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Investment Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Favor defensive allocation with tilt towards sectors resilient to sticky inflation and political risk (select commodities, US-based industrials, defense, and domestic consumer staples).</li>
<li>Tactical caution in broad equities until more clarity post-Jackson Hole, but do not overweight crash scenarios.</li>
<li>Gold and TIPS remain appropriate as macro hedge.</li>
<li>Shift attention to firms with tangible competitive advantages in AI, chips, or crypto enablement; avoid those exposed to rising tariff risk without pricing power.</li>
<li>Ongoing vigilance for escalation in US-Russia/China tensions and any hint that sticky inflation will force policy surprise (either from Fed or fiscal end).</li>
</ul>
