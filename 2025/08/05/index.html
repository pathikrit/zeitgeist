<h2>Macro &amp; Market Outlook</h2>
<h3>US Economy &amp; Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Growth/Employment</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Soft landing remains base case; moderate GDP growth expected (~1.5%-2.5% for 2025).</li>
<li>Labor market shows cracks: BLS data controversy and IT job cuts signal slowdown, but nothing resembling imminent recession.</li>
<li>Wage growth is keeping slightly ahead of inflation, which supports consumer strength, but hiring pace is decelerating.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inflation</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Core and headline CPI likely to remain in a slightly elevated range (2.8-3.6%) for rest of 2025.</li>
<li>Elevated NYC rents and persistent energy/commodities volatility add pressure.</li>
<li>US government spending increases (&gt; $500B) and high national debt will keep investors wary of future inflation spikes or interest rate volatility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monetary Policy</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>No near-term emergency Fed action anticipated; base case is for 1-2 rate cuts in 2025, with cuts more likely than hikes.</li>
<li>Leadership uncertainty (potential Trump appointee like Kevin Warsh or Kevin Hassett) could shake market confidence in Fed independence in event of a Trump victory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fiscal &amp; Currency Risks</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>US debt will rise above $38T; persistent deficits telegraph long-term inflation and currency dilution risk.</li>
<li>USD index at risk of declining; de-dollarization undertones continue, which boosts case for diversification into non-USD assets (e.g., gold, select international equities).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trade/Geopolitics</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>New tariffs likely—especially on copper and Indian goods—risk escalation in global trade wars, supply chain disruptions, and imported inflation.</li>
<li>China is unlikely to overtake US economy by 2030, but continued strategic rivalry will shape policy—expect more tech/trade controls.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Risks</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Recession Watch</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-trivial risk of IMF declaring a global recession by 2027, driven by policy missteps or emerging market stress.</li>
<li>Emerging markets face pressure: Brazilian real is forecast to weaken, and external shocks (energy, USD) could have outsized effects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Climate &amp; Natural Disasters</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>CO2 atmospheric concentration expected to breach high thresholds (440-445 ppm), reinforcing climate risk.</li>
<li>Wildfire smoke and severe weather events disrupt economic activity and raise insurance/utility costs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Asset Themes</h2>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Fossil Fuels</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>BP's massive Brazil oil find signals majors' oil pivot; significant for Brazil/O&amp;G capex; watch for new investment cycles there.</li>
<li>Despite renewable push, oil and coal remain dominant global energy sources through 2030; long-term transitions are happening slower than priced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Energy Prices</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>WTI oil range is volatile: prices may swing widely ($50–$90 bracket); trade/tariff headlines can whipsaw commodity markets.</li>
<li>Gasoline prices are set to rise in Texas and California, feeding into transport and consumer inflation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Metals</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tariffs on copper would tighten global supply chains, pressure industrial input costs, and potentially spur inflation for manufacturers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology &amp; Semiconductors</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>US Semiconductor Growth</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Robust expansion (&gt;7%+ output for 2025), with elevated demand for AI/datacenter chips.</li>
<li>Nvidia is favored to remain the world's largest company, underlining AI/semis dominance; supply chain and export controls remain key risks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consumer Tech</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Samsung and Google protrude with new device cycles, intensifying smartphone/AI feature arms race.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Estate</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Urban Housing</strong>:
<ul>
<li>NYC rents expected to sharply outpace inflation this year; office/urban REITs benefit in short-term but risk affordability crisis or regulatory backlash long-term.</li>
<li>Persistent mortgage/debt cost inflation keeps residential turnover low.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare/Biotech</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Drug Pricing &amp; Approvals</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insulin, Ozempic prices likely to fall (10+% declines plausible), reflecting policy scrutiny and payer-negotiated discounts. Watch for margin impact on major drugmakers.</li>
<li>Multiple FDA approvals on-track (Sebetralstat, Donidalorsen, Elinzanetant, Bumetanide NS) offer catalysts for mid-cap biotechs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative Therapies</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Psychedelic therapeutics have reasonable odds of FDA approval by 2027; regulatory bar still high.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials &amp; Bonds</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rates/Debt</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Elevated deficit, debt, and inflation prints keep Treasury yields range-bound but volatile.</li>
<li>TIPS and shorter-duration floats may outperform if inflation re-accelerates or if USD weakens further.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin/Ethereum</strong>:
<ul>
<li>BTC and ETH have strong upward momentum but remain prone to volatility; systemic risk exists if Tether (USDT) destabilizes, with low/medium probability of a depeg event.</li>
<li>Upside momentum for BTC reaching $125K+ and ETH north of $6K remains but as a tail risk, with corrections to $60-70K or lower also possible in adverse scenarios.</li>
<li>Watch for regulatory changes, stablecoin shocks, or US/EU policy moves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Companies/Events</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia (NVDA)</strong>: Outperformance likely continues as semis are strategic, but valuation risk is high.</li>
<li><strong>Palantir (PLTR)</strong>: Military/government contracts drive record results; further upside possible on government AI demand.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla (TSLA)</strong>: Musk's flagship remains volatile; giant pay package locks Elon in, ensuring steady innovation focus but raises governance/compensation concerns.</li>
<li><strong>BP</strong>: Significant new oil/gas assets; could outperform global O&amp;G sector as fossil fuel balance reasserts itself.</li>
<li><strong>Nintendo</strong>: No new mainline Zelda game is expected in 2025; reduces near-term catalysts for upside.</li>
<li><strong>Tether (USDT)</strong>: Remains a key tail risk for crypto markets; monitor stability closely.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Emerging/Latent Risks &amp; Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li>Political volatility (US redistricting, legal probes, and data quality controversies) is likely to raise market uncertainty and episodic volatility.</li>
<li>Further tariffs or trade fights (India, China, copper, oil) present ongoing risk to global supply chains and input prices.</li>
<li>Rising air quality and climate incidents push climate adaptation, insurance, and clean infrastructure into focus (urban utilities, disaster-related bonds).</li>
<li>Increased regulatory progress in FDA biopharma and therapeutics (e.g., for psychedelics, weight loss) create asymmetric upside for specialty names.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Expect a moderately positive risk backdrop for equities, led by technology and semiconductors, but watch for rising political and global macro risks that could drive sharp episodic volatility. Prepare for continued inflation around 3%+, with urban rents and energy as key contributors. Monitor US fiscal/monetary signaling, trade/tariff news, and crypto stability for volatility triggers. Defensive allocations, selective risk in commodities and real assets, and a watchful stance on political/geopolitical developments remain prudent.</p>
