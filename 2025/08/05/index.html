<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Currency Outlook</h2>
<h3>US: Growth, Inflation, and Fiscal Uncertainty</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Growth Outlook</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite headline discussion of a possible Trump &quot;boom,&quot; market expectations center on middling GDP growth (likely near or slightly below 2%). Consensus downplays any outsized acceleration, indicating little broad-based upside for cyclicals.</li>
<li>Unemployment is projected to hover around 4%, suggesting a labor market that's softening but not collapsing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inflation Trajectory</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Market consensus sees inflation remaining above 3% for 2025, with only moderate risk of breaking above 4%. Core inflation persistence will challenge real rates and may limit the magnitude of any rally in long-duration bonds.</li>
<li>The odds of the Fed raising rates are extremely low, while a cut is widely anticipated. Market volatility from policy shifts is likely to stem from data disputes or headline risk, not central bank surprises.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fiscal Picture</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Despite noise around spending cuts, significant deficit reduction is unlikely; US debt is widely expected to breach new highs, with no feasible budget balancing in sight.</li>
<li>Expect persistent Treasury supply and a chronic fiscal drag on bond returns. The probability of a government shutdown before 2026 introduces short-term volatility risk during budget negotiations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>US Dollar &amp; Global Currencies</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Market sees the USD weak, with the DXY poised to make new lows and notable devaluation against several major currencies (e.g., EUR/USD support around 1.05).</li>
<li>The Mexican peso and Brazilian real face significant selling pressure, emblematic of acute EMFX risks that may spill over in risk-off episodes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Asset Class Implications</h2>
<h3>Equities</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>S&amp;P 500</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Markets price a modest upward trajectory for the S&amp;P through year-end and 2025, but most upside is limited (~6,200–6,800 range). The probability of extreme moves (either crashes or melt-ups) is low, pinpointing a grinding, range-bound market shaped by rates, macro and sector rotation.</li>
<li>The &quot;Magnificent 7&quot; is likely to maintain its dominance, as odds of market breadth rotation remain small for now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tech and Semiconductors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Semiconductors continue to stand out, with consensus for strong YoY production growth (well above 7–10%). Tailwinds from US reshoring, AI, and defense are significant.</li>
<li>Palantir's breakout quarter and ongoing enthusiasm for AI/surveillance names underscores institutional appetite for software with government/military adoption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consumer &amp; Healthcare</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wage growth is widely believed to outstrip inflation, supporting consumer purchasing power and retail/consumer discretionary resilience.</li>
<li>Drug price deflation is moderate, with insulin and Ozempic showing only mild to moderate expected declines—policy overhang remains, but no crash scenario for big pharma margins.</li>
<li>Diagnostics and cancer screening benefit from higher screening rates and headline-driven awareness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Energy &amp; Commodities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Oil markets are whipsawing: market expects prices to stay soft or weaken further by year-end, but traders are alert to the possibility of energy shocks tied to geopolitical risk or supply disruption.</li>
<li>US solar capacity expansion is robust (practically certain above 30 GWDC, probable up to 40 GWDC), despite soft expectations for &quot;breakout&quot; years. Renewable adoption continues but with realistic, moderate growth rates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Crypto</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin and Ethereum are projected to remain volatile but trend higher, with Bitcoin expected to handily surpass previous highs ($100K+ seems baked in, but ultra-bullish targets are still seen as longshots). Downside risk is limited but possible.</li>
<li>Litecoin and Ethereum have upside momentum, but the market is wary of sudden drawdowns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interest Rates, Bonds, and Credit</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Treasuries and Rates</strong>
<ul>
<li>The 10-year Treasury yield is expected to remain range-bound with little indication of major moves; rate cuts are expected but already priced, limiting duration upside.</li>
<li>The high and rising US national debt, in the absence of spending cuts, maintains the risk of term premium repricing or bond market indigestion—supporting a cautious approach on long-duration fixed income.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Thematic Observations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>US-China/Emerging Market Risks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trade policy and tariff revenues are likely to rise, contributing to inflation persistence and adding strain to EM exporters and US multinationals with China or Mexico exposure.</li>
<li>Ongoing de-dollarization themes (declining DXY) favor emerging market/commodity exposure, but local shocks (like virus outbreaks, climate events) pose acute event risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Geopolitical &amp; Event Driven</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Europe’s stepped-up purchases of US defense hardware tied directly into the government/defense export complex.</li>
<li>Middle Eastern volatility (Israel/Gaza) can cause sudden oil spikes despite low base case, keep an eye on supply shock scenarios.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Idiosyncratic Company Moves</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Palantir: Institutional adoption inflection evident; story likely to drive further outperformance and sector tailwinds.</li>
<li>Apple: iPhone 17 cycle confirmed for September, maintaining tech hardware in focus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Tactical Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stay neutral to slightly positive on broad US equities; avoid chasing extremes but rotate into select tech, AI/software, and US manufacturing/semis.</li>
<li>Remain underweight long-duration bonds due to fiscal supply overhang, but retain exposure to areas benefiting from rate stability/cuts (TIPs, shorter-duration IG).</li>
<li>Position for persistent, though not runaway, inflation—favor real assets (commodities, gold) and select EM exposure with currency hedges.</li>
<li>Monitor event risk from government shutdown headlines, trade negotiations, and Middle East/Eastern Europe conflict escalation.</li>
<li>Look for idiosyncratic opportunities in software (AI, analytics), diagnostics, and US defense exporters.</li>
<li>Stay nimble in crypto; treat recent strength in Bitcoin/Ethereum as structural but guard against sharp pullbacks.</li>
</ul>
