<h1>Daily Memo (05-Aug-2025)</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Key News Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Politics &amp; Trade:</strong> Trump administration's new tariffs have started to impact a broad range of economies, with modelling suggesting the US itself also faces significant drawbacks. The White House confirms &quot;further modifications&quot; to reciprocal tariff rates. Senate gridlock continues, including delays for Trump nominees.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market:</strong> Tech sector layoffs are increasing this year versus 2024. Boeing defense workers initiate significant strike action, potentially affecting defense sector supply chains and timelines.</li>
<li><strong>US Fiscal Issues:</strong> Reports of continued US government deficit growth; significant challenges to reducing government spending despite rhetoric.</li>

<li><strong>Geopolitics:</strong> Israel advances plans for full occupation of Gaza, increasing Middle East risks and potential knock-on impacts for energy markets.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong> Institutional adoption continues, with another S&amp;P 500 company set to buy bitcoin; no imminent signs of systemic collapse in Tether or other stablecoins.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer Trends:</strong> Retail stocks like American Eagle see unusual price movement linked to cultural/political endorsements; tariffs impacting consumer electronics pricing (e.g., Nintendo Switch).</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> US policy debate intensifies around healthcare, pharma tariffs, and detection of emerging health threats (bird flu, colon cancer in younger adults).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Currency</h2>
<h3>US Economy &amp; Fiscal Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Near-term US recession risk remains contained, with no acute recession expected in 2025; positive economic growth anticipated under new Trump administration but with substantial deficit expansion.</li>
<li>US national debt is set to surpass $38T this year, with little expectation of significant deficit reduction, despite talk of spending cuts.</li>
<li>Government spending remains on an upward trajectory this year; prospects for meaningful fiscal tightening are low.</li>
<li>Trade tensions remain central: new tariffs are likely to be enacted on key economies (East Asia, Mexico, Canada, EU) and specific sectors (semiconductors, pharma, industrial metals). Early models suggest global economic headwinds and potential harm to US consumers from these new tariffs.</li>
<li>The USD is likely to weaken on a trade-weighted basis, but no severe &quot;de-dollarization&quot; event on the immediate horizon; risks remain moderate for significant currency dislocations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interest Rates &amp; Inflation</h3>
<ul>
<li>The probability of a Fed rate hike in 2025 is very low, with a cut much more likely. Emergency rate cuts and rate hold scenarios are both considered low probability.</li>
<li>Inflation expectations for 2025 are clustered in the 2.6-4% range—above pre-pandemic averages but not at crisis levels. Core inflation is similarly elevated.</li>
<li>The 10-year Treasury yield is expected to remain contained, with no immediate signs of a runaway bond selloff.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Global &amp; Geopolitical</h2>
<h3>Europe &amp; EU</h3>
<ul>
<li>The EU is unlikely to meet its 2030 climate goals, with political focus shifting amid new member accessions and limited risk of countries leaving the bloc in the near-term.</li>
<li>EU may expand membership by 2030, signaling ongoing integration rather than fragmentation.</li>
<li>Tariffs and new trade tensions between the US and Europe may trigger retaliatory measures, affecting sectors such as autos, agriculture, and manufacturing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>China &amp; EM</h3>
<ul>
<li>China's overtaking of the US economy before 2030 remains a minority scenario; EM economies are not seen as major disruptors in the near-term.</li>
<li>India is on track for its climate goals, whereas large economies like the US and EU are not, suggesting regional divergence in climate policy's economic impacts.</li>
<li>The BRICS group is likely to add new members before 2027, increasing its potential future relevance but with unclear short-term market impact.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Middle East &amp; Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rising hostilities in Gaza and threats to regional stability raise the prospect of further energy supply disruptions or short-term volatility, even as oil price models point toward moderate to low prices for the remainder of this year.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors</h2>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li>The global energy mix by 2030 remains dominated by fossil fuels (coal and oil), indicating a slower transition to renewables than climate advocates hope. This has implications for energy equities, industrials, and related commodities.</li>
<li>Oil prices are likely to remain range-bound through year-end, with more downside than upside risk in the very near term, but significant geopolitical events could cause volatility spikes.</li>
<li>Tariffs on copper and other industrial metals are probable, adding potential cost pressures to manufacturing and technology supply chains.</li>
<li>US solar buildout continues, with large capacity additions this year but falling short of more aggressive targets; signaling both growth and ongoing headwinds for clean tech.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology &amp; Semiconductors</h3>
<ul>
<li>New tariffs on semiconductors and persistent tech layoffs (likely above last year’s totals) suggest caution both for cost structures and labor mobility in the tech sector.</li>
<li>Antitrust scrutiny is rising: high likelihood of courts finding Amazon, Apple, and Live Nation as monopolies before 2030. This introduces headline and regulatory risk for these stocks, as well as possible sector-wide adjustments.</li>
<li>Nvidia remains the dominant force in both AI and semiconductors, with substantial odds of ranking as the world's most valuable company by year-end, partly on AI/data center momentum and product leadership.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Industrial &amp; Defense</h3>
<ul>
<li>Labor disruption in aerospace/defense (Boeing strikes) could have medium-term impact on supply chains and contract deliveries in defense programs and jet production.</li>
<li>Manufacturing is a political focus, with new investment vehicles emerging to capitalize on policy-driven &quot;reshoring&quot; tailwinds, though trade war risks are significant.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pharma faces risk of tariffs, blurring previously clear defensive characteristics. Health crises like bird flu and rising early-stage colon cancer detection rates continue to pressure public health and policy spending.</li>
<li>Tech-driven healthcare applications (AI, diagnostics) are likely to accelerate, but cost and price headwinds may persist.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Estate &amp; REITs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rental prices in major US metros (NYC, SF) are rising strongly this year, suggesting ongoing tightness in urban multifamily real estate and possible over-index for REITs with exposure in these markets.</li>
<li>Wealth migration from high-tax cities like NYC is a slow-moving but persistent risk for future tax receipts and luxury real estate valuations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Institutional crypto adoption is accelerating—S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to continue adding bitcoin to their treasuries.</li>
<li>Major systemic risk from stablecoins (Tether) not perceived in the near-term.</li>
<li>Both Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to show strong price appreciation potential, yet tail risks for extreme upside remain modest relative to base case.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Companies &amp; Themes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia</strong>: Set to maintain or even expand dominance in AI, datacenter, and semiconductor spaces; highly likely to be the thematic earnings bellwether for quarters ahead.</li>
<li><strong>Apple &amp; Amazon</strong>: Heightened regulatory/antitrust risk, although no immediate leadership changes are expected at Apple or Google.</li>
<li><strong>Live Nation</strong>: Increased probability of monopoly ruling could reshape live event ticketing.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla</strong>: Not on track to regain “largest company” status despite being a macro mover; regulatory/tariff exposure remains under Trump trade policies.</li>
<li><strong>Palantir</strong>: Strong earnings and AI exposure drive positive sentiment, but valuation concerns linger.</li>
<li><strong>Boeing</strong>: Strike activity and persistent supply-chain challenges in defense are likely to weigh on near-term results.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Summary/Thesis</h2>
<p>Short-term US macro remains growth-oriented but fragile, weighed by fiscal profligacy, tariff escalation, and regulatory ambiguity. The US consumer faces new price pressures via tariffs, particularly on imported goods and technology. Tech and energy sectors remain in focus, with Nvidia and renewables as outperformers, but both face supply chain, regulatory, and labor risk. Real estate in major coastal metros benefits from rent inflation, while crypto cementing further institutional acceptance. Antitrust winds swirl around US tech titans, introducing new headline risks. Globally, persistent climate and geopolitical risks reinforce the case for maintaining exposures across commodities, energy, and defensive assets, while diversification remains paramount amid increasing cross-currents.</p>
<p><strong>Actionable:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Watch for tariff and regulatory developments, especially affecting technology, manufacturing, and consumer discretionary.</li>
<li>Monitor continued dollar weakness and adjust non-USD exposure accordingly.</li>
<li>Tilt toward sectors/regions with supportive policy trends (AI, solar, urban REITs, select EM climate leaders).</li>
<li>Remain vigilant to both inflation and secular stagnation risks as the policy environment remains volatile.</li>
</ul>
