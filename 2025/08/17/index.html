</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Geopolitics</h2>
<h3>Economic Growth, Inflation, and the Fed</h3>
<ul>
<li>The prospect of a &quot;Trump economic boom&quot; with GDP growth greater than 5% is not well-supported by underlying probabilities, with forecasts much more moderate (closer to 1.5–2.0% growth in 2025).</li>
<li>Unemployment is likely to remain above 4%, with job growth sluggish but positive.</li>
<li>Inflation is looking sticky, with broad expectation of CPI above 3% for 2025 and Core CPI trending at or above 3%, despite recent disinflation in some goods.</li>
<li>The Federal Reserve is broadly expected to implement at least 1–2 modest rate cuts by end-2025 (with very low probability of hikes or emergency activity). Market-implied rates settle well below 4.5% for late 2026, supporting lower yields and favoring intermediate bonds over cash or ultra-short durations.</li>
<li>US debt is virtually certain to exceed $38 trillion by year-end, with persistent, large deficits and no major spending contraction expected.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Investment Implications</h4>
<ul>
<li>Higher-for-longer inflation keeps inflation hedges (commodities, TIPS) relevant.</li>
<li>Fed rate pause/cuts and contained growth may benefit duration risk and favor tech/growth sectors.</li>
<li>Large US deficits heighten risk for an eventual bond market shakeup, but short-run default fears remain low.</li>
<li>Social Security outlook deterioration may contribute to increased consumer caution and long-run pressure on consumer staples, financials, and housing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics and Trade</h3>
<ul>
<li>While major confrontation with China is slotted for lower probability before 2030, a significant Trump-driven tariff escalation is nearly certain for the remainder of the year. New tariffs will likely target China, South Korea, Taiwan, Mexico, the EU, India, and Canada—impacting a wide array of goods, including semiconductors, copper, pharmaceuticals, and luxury products.</li>
<li>A large new free trade agreement with a country other than China is probable soon, but a US-China deal is less likely before 2029.</li>
<li>Mexico’s peso will remain weak due to trade friction, with USD/MXN likely volatile but not expected to breach major highs.</li>
<li>Geopolitical flash points: The Israel/Gaza crisis could escalate further, and Russia-Ukraine headlines remain significant but with low likelihood of near-term ceasefire.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Investment Implications</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tariff-heavy environment benefits domestic manufacturing, select resource/commodity players, and onshoring names.</li>
<li>Exporters and firms heavily exposed to Swiss, EU, and Asian partners face margin pressures.</li>
<li>Ongoing instability in the Middle East/Ukraine can pressure energy markets and industrial supply chains.</li>
<li>Emerging-market currency risk (esp. MXN) is elevated, but advanced-market FX moves (USD/JPY, EUR/USD) are muted.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors</h2>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<ul>
<li>US tech remains in focus amid tariff threats; domestic-oriented firms may outshine those with heavy China/Germany/Switzerland exposure.</li>
<li>AI sector: OpenAI appears likely to IPO before Anthropic. Anticipate robust demand for leading AI exposures.</li>
<li>Consumer tech is pivoting: Apple faces margin and unit risk as Samsung’s foldables gain ground. Rumors of iPhone lineup changes and launch of foldables may create short-term volatility and longer-run competitive headwinds for Apple.</li>
<li>Semiconductor tariffs are imminent—watch for short-term disruption and longer-run opportunity for US-based fabs and supply chain localization.</li>
<li>Crypto legislation is likely but major new tax exemptions are unlikely this year, leaving sector under a mixed, but modestly clarifying regulatory regime.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare/Biotech</h3>
<ul>
<li>FDA output: moderate new drug approval pace. No near-term breakthrough in diabetes cures, but psychedelic medical approvals are possible. Price competition continues, with insulin and Ozempic prices under some pressure but not expected to collapse.</li>
<li>Healthcare sector volatility can rise if Covid increases are not matched by timely vaccine deployment. Flu season may see a shift to home-delivery options.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials</h3>
<ul>
<li>JPMorgan CEO succession likely in 2025, with internal candidates leading. No evidence of major disruption.</li>
<li>Broader banking sector not expected to face immediate regulatory or market stress. Credit card fee increases may pressure consumer spending.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consumer, Industrials, &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consumer discretionary may falter as high borrowing costs and tariffs strain household finances and luxury purchases.</li>
<li>Tariffs hit automotive, electronics, luxury watches (Swiss), and manufacturing, presenting risks and domestic opportunities.</li>
<li>Commodities: Copper in the tariff crosshairs and potential for demand swings; gold/energy could benefit from macro and geopolitical uncertainty.</li>
<li>Domestic industrials and materials with limited import reliance are favored amid continued onshoring trends.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Equities &amp; Thematic Watchlist</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple</strong>: Facing rising competitive threat in the US from Samsung; no imminent foldable iPhone in 2025, but significant disruption to pricing and model lineup ahead. Margins and market share are at risk.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI/Anthropic</strong>: Expect OpenAI to reach public markets first, which could set the tone for broader AI investment enthusiasm.</li>
<li><strong>Stripe/Klarna</strong>: Klarna is more likely to IPO first, suggesting investor appetite for international fintech growth stories.</li>
<li><strong>JPMorgan</strong>: CEO transition will likely be orderly, potential for modest market reaction but no outsized risk.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto</strong>: Major coins (BTC, ETH) are much more likely to reach new highs than lows in 2025, supported by anticipated regulatory surety but limited by lack of major pro-crypto tax legislation.</li>
<li><strong>Swiss luxury brands</strong>: Immediate tariff pain and loss of US market share likely. Watch for opportunities in domestic luxury or in new &quot;tariff-evading&quot; value chains.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Key Risks &amp; Monitors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tariff escalation and retaliatory moves remain the dominant theme, with potential to disrupt global supply chains and margins across tech, industrials, and luxury.</li>
<li>Political volatility in the US (protests, National Guard deployment, redistricting battles) increases event risk for consumer and public sector companies.</li>
<li>Rising inflation and tepid growth can produce a stagflation-lite environment, impacting consumer, REITs, and financials.</li>
<li>Middle East and Eastern Europe remain high-impact but currently low-likelihood sources of market shocks.</li>
<li>Severe weather (hurricanes, public health outbreaks) remain latent near-term risks for insurance, travel, logistics, and retail.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Environment remains risk-on for US tech and domestic-facing manufacturing but risk-off for global exporters and high-end discretionary. Stay alert to rapid developments in trade policy, consumer tech dynamics, and monetary policy clarity. Continue monitoring inflation, interest rate clues, and any escalation of geopolitical tensions.</p>
