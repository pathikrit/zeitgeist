<h2>Macro and Market Outlook</h2>
<h3>US Economy &amp; Monetary Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Recession Watch</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Risks of a US recession in 2025 remain moderate but not overwhelming; labor market is flashing some warning signs (AI, layoffs, slow job growth).</li>
<li>Unemployment has started edging up and initial jobless claims are trending higher.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inflation &amp; Rates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Inflation expectations are sticky and likely to remain above the Fed’s 2% target; most scenarios anticipate CPI above 3% for 2025.</li>
<li>Fed is expected to cut rates by 1–2 times by year end; little possibility of rate hikes, emergency cuts, or outright policy reversal.</li>
<li>Yields on long-term Treasuries are unlikely to spike but could see brief surges on macro or fiscal shocks.</li>
<li>Debt levels will cross $38 trillion, increasing duration risk and putting upward pressure on real rates or crowding out private investment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fiscal &amp; Debt</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>High probability of US government debt expansion, leaving little room for large budget cuts. Government shutdown risk is higher than average.</li>
<li>Market seems to be discounting outright default but remains alert to shocks, especially if political gridlock increases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Index Implications</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>US equity markets (S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq 100) are biased to finish positive on the year but with increased volatility driven by macro uncertainty.</li>
<li>Index composition remains top-heavy; the &quot;Magnificent 7&quot; techs will continue to dominate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>FX &amp; Global Macro</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>US dollar index outlook is weak, reflecting heavy debt issuance and persistent trade imbalances, though not signaling outright crisis.</li>
<li>BRICS and EM currency blocs grow in relevance but USD holds dominance for now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector and Thematic Highlights</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Growth Leadership</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Leadership in market cap will stay with Nvidia and Microsoft; Apple and Alphabet unlikely to retake #1 spots. Nvidia strength aided by AI/semis momentum.</li>
<li>Semiconductor sector is on track for robust production growth; supply chain improvements and AI adoption drive demand for chips.</li>
<li>Regulatory risk is increasing for big tech (Apple, Amazon, Live Nation) with courts likely to lean toward monopoly designations; expect ongoing legal and compliance costs, with unclear, but possibly negative, long-term impact on margin and growth rates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI Adoption</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>AI is a double-edged sword—boosting tech sector capex and profits but also contributing to white-collar job disruption and productivity/inequality debates.</li>
<li>Palantir and AMD earnings poised to benefit from defense, AI, cloud, and government digitalization contracts, but must navigate export controls and global market fragmentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Biotech</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pharma Pipeline</strong>
<ul>
<li>Several near-term FDA approvals likely for drugs in rare disease, cardiovascular, and menopause markets—notably Sebetralstat, Donidalorsen, Bumetanide nasal spray, and Elinzanetant. Type 1 diabetes &quot;cure&quot; remains at very low probability in the next decade.</li>
<li>Drop in vaccination rates and resurgence in measles cases may drive short-term demand for healthcare providers and public health spending, but also pose risks for hospital cost pressures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy Mix &amp; Geopolitics</strong>
<ul>
<li>Oil and coal will remain dominant in global energy mix through 2030, renewables will grow but will not overtake fossil fuels imminently.</li>
<li>Solar installation growth continues but modestly misses aggressive targets—policy/general capital allocation favored to grid, gas backup, and critical metals.</li>
<li>New tariffs, especially on copper and Brazilian products, likely to shift global commodity trade flows, create price volatility in industrial metals and agri-business.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Estate &amp; Inflation Hedges</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rent/Real Estate</strong>
<ul>
<li>Strong rent increases forecast for New York City and San Francisco in 2025, supporting multi-family/REIT prospects in these cities.</li>
<li>Persistent inflation prints and bullish outlook for gold—precious metals to remain in favor as inflation/deficit hedges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crypto Resilience</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin and Ethereum are set for constructive years, with substantial probability of both setting new highs. Decision on Ripple and Dogecoin ETFs may provide further support.</li>
<li>Downturn risk for crypto exists but capitulation/run risk is limited; institutions less likely to exit after ETF approvals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company-Specific and Legal/Regulatory Events</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Antitrust</strong>
<ul>
<li>Courts are increasingly likely to find tech giants (Apple, Amazon) and Live Nation as monopolies; expect amplified antitrust scrutiny and potential break-up/structural remedies over years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Leadership Watch</strong>
<ul>
<li>Apple, Alphabet, and OpenAI leadership appear stable short-term; no strong evidence of near-term disruption at CEO level.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Earnings Themes</strong>
<ul>
<li>BlackRock focused on digital assets, ETF flows, and record AUM; Palantir touts government contracts and AI ramp; AMD continues to message AI, datacenter, and automotive traction.</li>
<li>Nvidia set to continue its run as a bellwether for AI, with strong earnings narratives centered on AI, data center, and international scale.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2nd &amp; 3rd Order Effects to Monitor</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing trade/tariff escalations may alter inflation expectations and commodify supply chain exposures, particularly in industrial metals and agri-products.</li>
<li>Tech sector’s dominance could draw further regulation and taxation if inequality/job disruption themes persist.</li>
<li>The mix of growing energy demand, persistent fossil fuel reliance, and geopolitical tensions will likely keep energy/commodities markets volatile.</li>
<li>Continued shifts in public health policy, vaccination hesitancy, and sporadic outbreaks: knock-on effects on healthcare utilization, labor productivity, and insurer risk models.</li>
<li>Government data reliability and perceived politicization of economic stats (‘statistical capture’) may drive volatility in macro/FX and safe-haven assets.</li>
</ul>
