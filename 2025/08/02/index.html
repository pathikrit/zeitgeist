<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Markets</h2>
<h3>Growth, Jobs, and Policy Uncertainty</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>US economic trajectory is increasingly volatile.</strong> While a near-term &quot;Trump boom&quot; is bandied about, jobs data is underwhelming and unemployment is likely rising past 4%. Public firings of statisticians may erode trust in official economic data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Short-term, market confusion will likely create pockets of volatility, especially in labor- and consumer-driven sectors.</li>
<li>Political interventions and trade protectionism (tariffs) are feeding inflationary undertones.</li>
<li>The government is on track for significant new spending, maintaining a deficit expansionary stance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Credit and broader risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bankruptcy rates are climbing — expect fallout in leveraged and cyclical industries.</li>
<li>Slight but notable chances of further US credit downgrades, which could raise Treasury yields and undermine faith in US government obligations.</li>
<li>Treasury yields remain a critical watchpoint, especially as net new debt issuance soars.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inflation &amp; Fed Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Sticky inflation is a central feature of the next 6–18 months.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most forecasts suggest core and headline inflation well north of 3% for the year.</li>
<li>While extreme inflation (above 6%) is unlikely, persistent price growth undermines confidence in a rapid rate-cut cycle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Federal Reserve at a crossroads:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Leadership change is nearly certain, with higher odds of a Trump-leaning or hawkish chair by 2026.</li>
<li>Multiple rate cuts are viewed as possible but not dominant scenarios — the market is torn between slower growth and stubborn prices.</li>
<li>There is a non-negligible chance of further political interference in Fed independence, posing tail risks for monetary credibility and USD value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Macro</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recession risk remains highest in Japan, UK, Germany—with China and India less at risk but still exposed.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Emerging global recession concerns (per IMF) are not base case but should not be ignored for cyclical sectors.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Major geopolitical flashpoints are unlikely to tip into outright war short term, but vigilance is warranted for supply chain- and commodity-sensitive equities (especially semis and energy).</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Key Themes</h2>
<h3>Energy, Commodities &amp; Climate</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Fossil fuels remain dominant through 2030; coal and oil retain the largest market shares for primary global energy.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Energy transition equities, while high-profile, are set for long-term growth but face headwinds from slow displacement of legacy assets.</li>
<li>Natural gas prices are expected to rise materially this year. Oil is volatile, with both downside and explosive upside possible — positioning in both commodity’s derivatives and associated equities should hedge for large swings.</li>
<li>US oil production will not leap dramatically, capping rapid margin growth for local upstream players.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Climate trajectory:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exceeding 2C warming by 2050 is seen as highly probable, suggesting physical climate risk and regulatory pressure will only increase.</li>
<li>This bakes in mounting costs (and possibly stranded asset risk) for polluting sectors; insurance, utilities, and long-duration infrastructure are directly impacted.</li>
<li>US solar installation will continue, but not enough to upset energy incumbency in the near term.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI remains the tech sector’s core growth catalyst.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Leadership in foundational models rests most securely with xAI and Google, with Meta as a meaningful challenger.</li>
<li>US semiconductor production growth is exceptionally robust (&gt;7% expected); sector is somewhat insulated from macro softness, though isolated supply chain shocks (e.g., Taiwan security events) would present outlier risk.</li>
<li>Nvidia looks set to be the preeminent large-cap globally by year-end, leveraging AI tailwinds; other mega-cap techs (Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla) lag notably behind in expected dominance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials, Crypto, and Payments</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bankruptcies are mounting, hinting at growing stress in commercial credit and potential opportunities in distressed assets.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Crypto adoption continues inroads into S&amp;P 500 companies—watch for further balance sheet diversification and catalyst-driven price moves in Bitcoin and related assets.</strong></li>
<li><strong>X (&quot;Twitter&quot;) Payments has a coin flip chance of launch this year; would be a critical development in fintech/blockchain but not yet a sector pivot.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Defense, Geopolitics &amp; Real Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defense sector remains supported by persistent global tensions (Russia, Middle East, East Asia).</strong></li>
<li><strong>US government asset sales and military procurement shifts (e.g., Army vehicle refresh) reflect ongoing modernization and possible new prime winner cycles for contractors.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Real estate market faces policy overhang, especially with potential asset divestitures and fiscal constraints.</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Names &amp; Notable Events</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia</strong>: Poised to remain the largest public company, driven by leadership in AI and semis. Robust foundry/output growth remains a key thesis.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla</strong>: Under renewed regulatory, legal and competitive scrutiny (major damages in Autopilot ruling). Longer-term market share and profit risks for the EV sector; further legal setbacks possible.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon</strong>: Highly unlikely to unseat Nvidia for market cap leadership this year, suggesting growth and narrative focus remains on AI and hardware-oriented players.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Consolidated Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Allocation guiding themes:</strong> Remain overweight sectors with persistent positive idiosyncratic growth stories (semis, defense, select AI names), be cautious on broad consumer cyclicals and extremely interest-rate sensitive segments (REITs, leveraged staples, and credit).</li>
<li><strong>Commodities &amp; energy remain volatile and speculative:</strong> Build hedges or keep nimble exposure. Watch for supply/demand inflections from policy (tariffs, production quotas) and geopolitical stressors.</li>
<li><strong>Rising insolvency risk and credit downgrades:</strong> Monitor high-yield and distressed debt opportunities, but beware of value traps in leveraged sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Macro and policy risk elevated:</strong> Closely track US and global fiscal/monetary maneuvering and major appointments, as policy surprises will likely drive near-term price action.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Stay nimble: The landscape remains unusually fluid, with policy, inflation, and technology driving the lion’s share of near-term returns and volatility.</strong></p>
