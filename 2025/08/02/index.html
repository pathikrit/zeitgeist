<h1>Daily Memo (02-Aug-2025)</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Key News Developments</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shock US jobs report:</strong> Labor data shows significant weakness, with major downward revisions to recent job growth—raising expectations for near-term Fed rate cuts; Commissioner of BLS fired by President Trump.</li>
<li><strong>US market volatility:</strong> Markets drop significantly after Trump imposes new steep tariffs on additional countries, increasing global trade tensions and uncertainty.</li>
<li><strong>Fed shake-up:</strong> A Fed governor resigns early, allowing Trump to immediately appoint a new Fed board member—adding uncertainty to future monetary policy.</li>
<li><strong>Corporation for Public Broadcasting shuts down:</strong> Defunded by Congress and the Trump administration, reflecting further US budget tightening.</li>
<li><strong>Global security:</strong> Trump redeploys US nuclear submarines in response to Russian threats, escalating military posturing. Russia-Ukraine ceasefire prospects remain low for 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla found liable for Autopilot fatal crash:</strong> Jury awards over $200 million in damages, casting new scrutiny on Tesla’s technology risk profile.</li>
<li><strong>Tech sector:</strong> Major layoffs continue; regulatory and antitrust pressures on Big Tech remain elevated, with significant legal risk for Amazon, Apple, and Live Nation.</li>
<li><strong>US Senate advances three key funding bills:</strong> Minimizing near-term government shutdown risk.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Policy</h2>
<h3>US Economy &amp; Markets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growth:</strong> US GDP growth for 2025 is projected to be weak, with consensus for sub-2% (sluggish expansion). Q3’s outlook points to below-trend growth as well.</li>
<li><strong>Labor market:</strong> Unemployment appears to be creeping higher, with persistent risks of 4%+ this summer and a pronounced chance of further rise above 6% in coming years. The notably weak jobs report, ongoing tech layoffs, and the BLS commissioner’s firing point to fragility—and the potential for market shocks if data worsens.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation:</strong> There is a strong likelihood US inflation remains moderately elevated above 3% through 2025, with only a modest chance of a significant resurgence above 4% or outright stagflation.</li>
<li><strong>Fed policy:</strong> Several signs of imminent rate cuts, likely two or more by year-end, as the Fed responds to labor market softness and disappointing inflation progress. An emergency rate cut is unlikely barring a deeper crisis.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal:</strong> US debt remains historically high. Expect debt to surpass $38T by year-end, creating persistent upward pressure on long-term rates. Budget tightening is ongoing, visible in outspoken Congressional cuts (e.g., Corporation for Public Broadcasting), but a sharp “austerity” pivot appears unlikely given upcoming spending bills.</li>
</ul>
<h3>US Policy &amp; Politics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tariffs:</strong> New, broad tariffs from the Trump administration have rattled global markets. The most likely second-order effects include disrupted supply chains, increased import costs, and amplified inflation pressure. The longer tariffs persist, the greater the risk of global retaliation and reduced profit margins for multinationals.</li>
<li><strong>Democracy and governance:</strong> Multiple political stories (Biden's warnings, El Salvador term limits, and revived concerns on US political stability) reflect rising investor concerns about US and global democratic norms, with associated risk premia potentially affecting US equities and Treasuries.</li>
<li><strong>Welfare/consumer:</strong> SNAP benefits face risk of restriction under Trump, which would impact lower-income consumer demand and affect grocery and discount retail.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Macro &amp; Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trade:</strong> Severe trade friction (tariffs) and uncertain leadership shakeups (Fed, G7) are driving short-term risk and long-term uncertainty.</li>
<li><strong>Energy/geopolitics:</strong> Global energy remains exposed to shocks from Russia-Ukraine and Mideast instability, though probability of extreme events (such as nuclear detonation or Israeli leadership change) remains low.</li>
<li><strong>UK/Europe:</strong> Political risk is subdued in the UK—no significant change in PM or new elections expected soon.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Assets</h2>
<h3>Equities &amp; Risk Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market volatility:</strong> Expect continued chop in broad US equity indices due to tariff escalation, weakening job growth, and rising long-term rates.</li>
<li><strong>Tech:</strong> Tech layoffs are expected to rise further versus last year. Combined with regulatory headwinds (antitrust, monopoly risks for Amazon, Apple, Live Nation), caution on high-multiple names is warranted.</li>
<li><strong>Semiconductors/AI:</strong> Despite macro headwinds, US semiconductor production is set to maintain strong double-digit growth (notably for chips powering AI, with supply commentary from Nvidia and AMD expected to focus on data center and government demand). Nvidia is increasingly likely to end the year as the world’s largest company by market cap.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare/biotech:</strong> No imminent breakthroughs (e.g., Type 1 diabetes cure) are expected in the short term. Healthcare spending is unlikely to see transformative change unless driven by policy.</li>
<li><strong>Renewables/energy:</strong> Renewables continue to expand capacity (notably US solar installations), but fossil fuels—particularly coal and oil—retain prominence in global energy mix through 2030. Nuclear innovation advances are making progress, but commercial fusion remains several years away.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commodities &amp; Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy:</strong> Brent and WTI remain sensitive to Russia, Iran, and Israel distress. Tariffs could disrupt flows and add spot volatility. No imminent supply shocks, but persistent policy-driven uncertainty.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong> Crypto assets, notably Bitcoin and Ethereum, face a cautiously bullish scenario with strong upside potential, but extreme price targets ($200k+ BTC, $10k+ ETH) this year remain unlikely. Systemic risk events (e.g., USDT depegging) remain a tail risk, but not the base case.</li>
<li><strong>Gold/commodities:</strong> Geopolitical tension and budget stress continue to support demand for gold and select commodities as hedges.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonds &amp; Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long bonds:</strong> Rising US debt and deficit threaten further upward pressure on yields, limiting price upside for long-duration Treasuries.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation protection:</strong> TIPS/TIPZ remain rational for partial allocation with inflation expected to hover north of 3%. However, a significant inflation breakout above 5% is not anticipated.</li>
<li><strong>Credit:</strong> Both government and corporate funding costs are at risk of creeping higher due to both macro and geopolitical uncertainty.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Estate &amp; Insurance</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disaster risk:</strong> Talk of “tail risks” (supervolcano, major earthquake) is prominent but not likely to affect pricing or allocation near term. However, reinsurance and catastrophe-exposed sectors (e.g., California REITs, property insurers) face gradually rising risk premiums.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company-Specific &amp; Sector Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple, Amazon, Live Nation:</strong> Material antitrust risk with courts likely to rule against them on monopoly questions; regulatory overhang may weigh on share prices.</li>
<li><strong>JPMorgan:</strong> CEO succession becoming topical; less likely to cause disruption.</li>
<li><strong>Oracle, Palantir, Nvidia, AMD:</strong> Earnings focus on AI infrastructure, government contracts, and cloud investment (Oracle’s “Stargate” is the primary theme). Nvidia’s earnings will revolve around AI, data center growth, and global expansion; competitive and supply chain pressures remain.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla:</strong> Autopilot legal setbacks add headline risk. Broader regulatory pressure on EV and self-driving initiatives may follow.</li>
<li><strong>Other defense/AI:</strong> US military data center buildouts with small reactors are increasingly likely to begin in the next 5 years, with significant positive implications for defense- and tech-focused infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Immediate Investment Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Exercise caution on broad US equities with rising macro/geopolitical shocks and weak jobs growth.</li>
<li>Stay alert for further Fed rate cuts and allocate accordingly to shorter-duration bonds or inflation-protected assets.</li>
<li>Favor defensive sectors (utilities, healthcare, select consumer staples) given more volatile headlines and budget tightening affecting consumer demand.</li>
<li>Continue overweight to high-quality AI and semiconductor leaders, but hedge against near-term volatility and regulatory pressure.</li>
<li>Watch energy and commodity exposure closely amid tariff/trade disruptions and Mideast/Eastern Europe risks.</li>
<li>Crypto remains a tactical allocation; avoid outsized directional bets on extreme price outcomes.</li>
<li>Prepare for potentially abrupt swings from shifts in policy, Fed composition, and further regulatory actions.</li>
</ul>
