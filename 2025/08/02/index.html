</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Market Outlook</h2>
<h3>Growth, Recession, and Employment</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Growth:</strong> Most consensus is for US GDP to slow but not enter recession in 2025. Growth is expected to be moderate, likely in the 1-2.5% range, with outright contraction or strong acceleration both viewed as low probability.</li>
<li><strong>Jobs/Unemployment:</strong> Unemployment is poised to move higher, with expectations of a rise above 4% soon and more risk of distress over the next 2-5 years, but extreme spikes (&gt;10%) are not widely expected. Risks center on political disruptions and trade frictions rather than systemic collapse.</li>
<li><strong>Wages:</strong> Real wage growth is likely to outpace inflation, at least modestly, helping to cushion households from deteriorating macro conditions and tempering consumer demand pullback.</li>
<li><strong>Recession Odds:</strong> Risk of a near-term US or global recession has increased moderately, with international institutions paying close attention to trade and policy shocks, but imminent recession is still minority view. Negative GDP in a single quarter is possible but widely considered less likely than muddling through.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inflation &amp; Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Consensus is for US inflation to remain above the Fed's target in 2025, but runaway inflation (e.g., above 5%) is not a core scenario. Most see inflation in the 2.5-4% range, with plenty of debate about stickiness due to tariffs and supply shocks.</li>
<li><strong>Policy Response:</strong> The Fed is expected to remain patient, possibly executing one or two modest rate cuts in 2025, but more aggressive policy easing or renewed hikes are unlikely without a much bigger shock. Recent Fed board changes increase political risk around monetary policy, especially with the potential for new appointees to tilt dovish/hawkish unexpectedly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Government Shutdown Risk:</strong> Spending cliffs remain prominent as Congress faces budget deadlines; selective shutdowns or funding lapses are plausible but systemic/fiscal crisis is not base case.</li>
<li><strong>Debt Trajectory:</strong> US federal debt will keep climbing, passing $38T, with little expectation for material deficit reduction or spending cuts outside of high-profile targets.</li>
<li><strong>Tariff Revenues vs. Growth:</strong> Elevated tariff revenues are now likely, but at the expense of growth and corporate earnings in key sectors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commodities &amp; Currency</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy/Oil:</strong> Oil prices are likely to stay range-bound to lower over next 18 months due to slower growth and supply dynamics, but price spikes remain a tail risk should geopolitics escalate unexpectedly.</li>
<li><strong>Trade Policy Impact:</strong> High probability of new US tariffs on copper, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals, raising costs for industrials and tech, and possibly increasing volatility in supplier nations and commodity markets.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong> Bitcoin and Ethereum are expected to grind higher, with market-driven optimism on price gains through year-end, but outsized returns (e.g., Bitcoin &gt;$250k) still appear low-probability. ETF vehicles for other tokens (Litecoin, Cardano) are gaining mainstream acceptance.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Outlook</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; Semiconductors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tech Megacaps:</strong> Market concentration by tech giants in the S&amp;P is expected to persist; Nvidia is favored to remain or become the world’s largest company by market cap, reflecting market faith in AI boom.</li>
<li><strong>Semiconductors:</strong> Sector faces unique headwinds from new US tariffs/policy actions. Export controls and import duties will impact both AMD, Nvidia, and supply chain (notably TSMC and supply of advanced packaging). Expect commentary focused on regulatory challenges and technological advances in AI chips.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud &amp; Big Tech:</strong> Oracle earnings commentary to center on Stargate and ongoing capex/AI initiatives; expect focus on resilience and efficiency over revenue blowout. Microsoft and Apple retain core stable positioning, with management unlikely to change near-term.</li>
<li><strong>AI Regulation:</strong> Medium likelihood of a US AI safety bill passing; could create additional compliance burdens for platforms and modulate investor sentiment around AI's pace of deployment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset Managers:</strong> BlackRock is likely to focus on digital assets/crypto and record assets under management, reflecting ongoing shifts in investor preferences toward alternatives.</li>
<li><strong>ETF Flows:</strong> Continued strong flows into broad index and digital asset ETFs; traditional active strategies face a more challenging fee and margin environment.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Pharma</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tariff Risk:</strong> High likelihood of new US tariffs directly impacting pharmaceutical imports; US/foreign large-cap pharma could face increased cost of goods, potentially squeezing margins or forcing price negotiations internally.</li>
<li><strong>AI Adoption:</strong> Healthcare AI continues to be a marginal theme for broader tech, not a significant earnings driver yet.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Defense &amp; Aerospace</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Uncertainty:</strong> Rising tensions in Russia/Ukraine and military posturing (naval/air/space) can boost defense budgets and favor defense tech suppliers, but with volatility tied to escalation risks.</li>
<li><strong>Space Race:</strong> SpaceX launch volume is poised to remain at record highs, anchoring US commercial space dominance, but these names are largely private or indirect plays.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Industrials</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil Miners/Refiners:</strong> Range-bound/lower oil price outlook impacts cash flow and capex discipline; US-based names more vulnerable to policy/tariff disruption than Middle Eastern or non-US majors.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Equities &amp; Key Names</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia</strong>: Clear momentum, underpins AI and tech sector optimism; at risk for China headwinds, export restrictions, and tariff spillovers.</li>
<li><strong>AMD</strong>: Earnings focus on next-gen GPU/AI chip launches and supply chain resilience; trade/policy headwinds loom.</li>
<li><strong>Oracle</strong>: Will emphasize major AI infrastructure projects; expect warnings about capital allocation and project payback periods.</li>
<li><strong>Palantir</strong>: Government contracts/pipeline solid, increasing focus on “Warp Speed” and commercial opportunities, with defense tech spending tailwind.</li>
<li><strong>Uber</strong>: Earnings likely to highlight autonomous vehicle partnerships (Waymo), regulatory risk, and international diversification as ride-share and delivery growth plateaus.</li>
<li><strong>Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Tesla, Amazon</strong>: All expected to maintain existing leadership, little risk of near-term CEO turnover; few catalysts for dramatic stock moves absent broader macro/tech sector shift.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Key Risks &amp; Second-Order Effects</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trade War Escalation</strong>: New US tariffs risk global supply chain dislocations and tit-for-tat retaliation, particularly in semis, healthcare, copper/industrial inputs; spillover to inflation, earnings, and capital expenditures.</li>
<li><strong>Monetary Policy Instability</strong>: Increased Trump influence over the Fed could inject uncertainty into interest rate trajectory and inflation-fighting credibility, with knock-on implications for bond yields and US dollar stability.</li>
<li><strong>Populist Policy Shocks</strong>: High-profile agency funding cuts (e.g., Corporation for Public Broadcasting) hint at willingness to target politically sensitive spending elsewhere.</li>
<li><strong>Market Volatility</strong>: Stretched equity valuations heighten sensitivity to macro setbacks or policy error; circuit breaker or sharp correction risks not base case but not negligible.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical &amp; Defense</strong>: Any material escalation in conflict (Russia/Ukraine, Middle East) would drive risk-off rotation and defense sector outperformance, but event-driven risk is hard to time.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Actionable Themes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Maintain diversified exposure to US large-cap equities with risk controls for volatility.</li>
<li>Underweight traditional cyclical sectors facing hardest tariff or policy headwinds.</li>
<li>Prepare for US dollar and Treasury yield volatility; prefer shorter duration high-quality instruments unless policy clarity improves.</li>
<li>Hold select exposure to digital asset/crypto-linked products as flows and legitimacy continue to rise.</li>
<li>Remain nimble for policy and trade “shocks” and consider hedges for event-driven downside risk.</li>
</ul>
