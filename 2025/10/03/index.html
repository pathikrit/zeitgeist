<hr />
<h2>Macro Outlook</h2>
<h3>U.S. Economy &amp; Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li>Markets see very little chance of a Fed rate hike or emergency cut in 2025. However, there are firm expectations for roughly three rate cuts during the year, signaling a shift to a more accommodative stance.</li>
<li>The risk of a U.S. recession in 2025 is viewed as very low, with macro indicators expected to remain constructive for risk assets.</li>
<li>U.S. inflation is highly likely to exceed 3% in 2025, but there is little expectation of a move above 4%. Persistent above-target inflation, without runaway pressures, raises the prospect of a &quot;sticky&quot; inflation regime.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Investment Considerations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Duration risk in the U.S. remains manageable; long bonds likely to be stabilized by Fed easing expectations.</li>
<li>Equities’ valuation may be capped by persistent inflation, but earnings backdrop supported by strong macro and cost pass-through ability.</li>
<li>Sectors sensitive to continued above-target inflation (commodities, select real assets) may see tactical inflows.</li>
<li>Higher for longer inflation regime increases the appeal of TIPS and energy/gold hedges.</li>
</ul>
<h3>U.S. Fiscal &amp; Credit</h3>
<ul>
<li>No serious expectation of a U.S. debt default, but a nontrivial chance of another credit downgrade draws attention to Treasury supply, deficit dynamics, and budget politics.</li>
<li>Budget “balancing” proposals are not seen as credible; government shutdown drama continues, but wage and benefit payments are the most probable source of political bargaining chips.</li>
<li>Ongoing green energy project rollbacks and government spending uncertainty may reduce near-term investment in the renewable sector and create headwinds for certain segments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Investment Considerations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>UST yields may remain volatile on supply/demand concerns.</li>
<li>Defensive positioning around government-driven healthcare or energy providers advised.</li>
<li>Sectors highly exposed to federal contracts or subsidies face headline and execution risks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics &amp; International</h3>
<ul>
<li>No significant recession risk in the U.S., but European markets face continued instability from strikes and potential snap elections.</li>
<li>Elevated geopolitical friction in the Middle East, including the Israeli-Gaza situation, may sustain a risk premium in energy and defense.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Themes</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li>Large new investment in data centers and generative AI platforms (BlackRock, Perplexity) underscores the sector’s sustained growth and competitive pressure.</li>
<li>AI application breadth continues to expand, with early adoption in new entertainment, social, and productivity channels.</li>
<li>Major incumbents (Meta, Microsoft, Samsung) unlikely to be fully overturned by challengers in the near term; incumbent portfolio weighting remains supported.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unexpected refinery incidents add near-term tightness to U.S. energy markets.</li>
<li>Fossil fuel infrastructure/stocks may outperform in the wake of curtailed renewable investment and supply disruptions.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li>Regulatory uncertainty around abortion drugs and vaccine policy raises risk for companies exposed to these segments.</li>
<li>Persistent communicable disease outbreaks (measles) and possible policy retrenchments signal near-term disruption for vaccine and pediatric care providers.</li>
<li>Watch for volatility in public and private managed care, pediatric pharmaceuticals, and reproductive health names.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li>High probability that both Bitcoin and Ethereum register new highs through 2025, with substantial (though not extreme) upside from current levels, but very low likelihood of truly explosive moves.</li>
<li>Crypto’s integration into broader capital markets appears steady, but extreme speculative blowoffs or collapses are not anticipated.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Companies &amp; Events</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tesla:</strong> Despite beating delivery records on expiring subsidies, shares sell off—underscoring nervousness about future demand as subsidy support wanes.</li>
<li><strong>Chevron:</strong> Major fire at key refinery may create near-term volatility but likely not transformational unless it signals broader infrastructure risk.</li>
<li><strong>Meta, OpenAI, Samsung:</strong> Ongoing innovation in AI and software features—no dramatic changes to competitive positioning expected, but increased spending and adoption across consumer/enterprise likely.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare Providers (CVS, UNH, PFE, JNJ):</strong> Monitor for fallout from vaccine policy debates; some managed care and drug providers exposed to fluctuating guidance and political risk.</li>
<li><strong>Defense Contractors:</strong> Renewed hostilities (US-Mexico, Middle East) could provide support, though little risk of extreme escalation in 2025.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Summary Calls</h2>
<ul>
<li>Macro environment remains pro-equity and risk, with some inflation caution.</li>
<li>Defensive hard assets, select real assets (energy, TIPS, gold) provide hedging.</li>
<li>Continued overhang for green energy, healthcare policy-driven, and government contract-heavy sectors due to Washington instability.</li>
<li>Tech and AI remain core drivers; crypto to see further institutionalization but not runaway mania.</li>
<li>Monitor daily for political shocks and infrastructure news that could shift sectoral weights.</li>
</ul>
