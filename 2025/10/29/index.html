<p>Daily Memo (29-Oct-2025)</p>
<p>Top news to note</p>
<ul>
<li>Hurricane Melissa: Jamaica heavily damaged; expect regional insurance claims and temporary supply/logistics disruptions in the Caribbean.</li>
<li>U.S. shutdown: Growing impact on airports and federal benefits (SNAP) timing; House action most likely mid-November.</li>
<li>U.S.–Asia trade: U.S. and South Korea finalize tariff adjustments; Trump signals confidence on a China framework at the upcoming Xi meeting.</li>
<li>Israel–Gaza: Ceasefire appears fragile after strikes; headline risk remains elevated but broader regional escalation still not base case.</li>
<li>Nvidia crosses $5T: AI leadership and capex cycle remain intact into year-end.</li>
<li>Fed decision today: Another rate cut is broadly expected as labor indicators soften.</li>
<li>Boeing: Larger 777X charge, schedule pushed; cash burn improving but execution risk persists.</li>
<li>ACA premiums: Public filings indicate sizable 2026 increases; policy debate intensifying around subsidy extensions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Macro: base case, risks, positioning</p>
<ul>
<li>Growth/Inflation/Rates
<ul>
<li>Soft-landing base case holds: Q3 growth robust, Q4 moderating but positive; unemployment drifting into the mid‑4s; inflation trending in the upper‑2s to low‑3s.</li>
<li>Policy path: High confidence in a cut today and another into December; odds favor a cut again by January. The front end should lead, with the long end biased lower into year-end.</li>
<li>Implication: Add duration (prefer intermediate-to-long Treasuries), consider curve steepeners. Credit supported; avoid reaching for lower‑quality HY as bankruptcies grind higher.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fiscal/Shutdown
<ul>
<li>Shutdown looks prolonged (30+ days). Expect intermittent data gaps, airport delays, and benefit timing issues (SNAP). Consumer staples/discounters see a near‑term volume tailwind; travel/airlines headwinds build with service disruptions.</li>
<li>Treasury supply remains heavy; debt surpassing $38T this year is a near‑certainty. Despite issuance, easier Fed and slower growth argue for lower yields into year‑end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trade/Tariffs
<ul>
<li>Near‑term de‑escalation with China/South Korea is plausible (frameworks/targeted relief), but a structurally higher tariff regime into 2026 remains the central case (China mid‑20s to 30s aggregate rate).</li>
<li>Implication: Mildly inflationary, supportive of onshoring themes and select industrials; negative for import‑heavy retailers and parts of autos/electronics. Watch USD/CNY and Asia FX for tightening financial conditions spillovers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Commodities/FX
<ul>
<li>Oil: Skewed to a $65–$75 range absent a major Middle East shock; new OPEC cuts this year look unlikely. Prefer midstream over upstream beta.</li>
<li>Natural gas: Wide volatility band with upside spikes plausible (&gt;4 handle); utilities and chemicals should hedge exposures.</li>
<li>Gold: Strong upside skew into 2025 year‑end on deficits, geopolitics, and rate cuts; accumulation on dips remains favored.</li>
<li>USD: Downside bias as the Fed eases and Europe stabilizes; watch French political noise and added EU Russia‑sanctions for EUR volatility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Geopolitics
<ul>
<li>Middle East: Ceasefire headline risk persists; broader regional conflict not base case near‑term. Normalization steps in the region later in the cycle are plausible and supportive for defense.</li>
<li>Russia–Ukraine: Ceasefire this year unlikely; probability rises into 2026. Additional EU sanctions on Russia remain more likely than not; occasional energy/wheat volatility spikes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sectors: tilts and second‑order effects</p>
<ul>
<li>Rates‑sensitives/Housing
<ul>
<li>Falling mortgage rates into year‑end (a move below 6% looks attainable) supports homebuilders and select REITs; NYC rent growth remains firm while tech hubs see modest improvement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Defense/Aerospace
<ul>
<li>Budget visibility improves with elevated global risk; software‑led gov‑tech (data/AI) should outgrow peers. For aero, keep a quality bias; Boeing execution risk remains elevated on 777X schedule/charges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Energy
<ul>
<li>Favor pipelines/midstream distributions and integrateds with downstream leverage; underweight high‑beta E&amp;Ps given range‑bound crude and potential demand softness; prepare for gas price spikes with hedges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Healthcare
<ul>
<li>GLP‑1 price pressure risk is rising but likely incremental, not catastrophic. Managed care aided if ACA subsidy enhancements extend (more likely than not); PBMs remain in the regulatory crosshairs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Internet/Media
<ul>
<li>TikTok divestiture path this year is more likely than not; Oracle is a leading acquirer candidate. If the asset enters transition, U.S. ad platforms can see share tailwinds; if stabilized under a compliant buyer, competitive status quo persists, but regulatory overhang eases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Antitrust/Platforms
<ul>
<li>Live events, Apple App Store, and Amazon retail face sustained legal overhangs; remedies are likelier medium‑term than imminent but warrant modest multiple compression.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>EVs/Clean energy
<ul>
<li>EV share above 30% by 2030 is a reasonable base case; U.S. climate targets for 2030 look out of reach. Favor grid infrastructure, utility‑scale storage, and power‑market software over vehicle OEM beta.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Single‑name highlights (focus on near‑term investability)</p>
<ul>
<li>Nvidia: AI demand breadth supports continued estimate revisions; trim only on extreme moves—structural thesis intact.</li>
<li>Alphabet: Likely to headline model leadership into year‑end; YouTube product upgrades and Cloud operating leverage support upside; watch antitrust headlines, but risk/reward favorable.</li>
<li>Microsoft: AI suite expansion and partner ecosystem deepening; OpenAI legal noise manageable near‑term; beat‑and‑raise bias.</li>
<li>Amazon: E‑commerce resilience + AWS reacceleration; rate relief is a tailwind to consumer and SMB spend; antitrust risk discounted.</li>
<li>Oracle: Highest optionality on a TikTok outcome; secular AI/DB demand improves backlog visibility.</li>
<li>Palantir: Government pipeline strength and international expansion underpin upside; narrative reinforced by defense posture.</li>
<li>Tesla: Court outcome on Musk compensation likely favorable; autonomy/robotaxi broad rollout remains unlikely near‑term; energy storage is the more reliable growth driver; deliveries bias toward mid‑400Ks in Q4.</li>
<li>Boeing: Avoid until free‑cash‑flow trajectory stabilizes; supplier knock‑ons possible—monitor.</li>
<li>Live Nation: Elevated antitrust tail risk warrants a valuation discount.</li>
<li>Coinbase and crypto miners: ETF flows look positive this week, but the broader crypto path remains choppy; trade around flows rather than chase parabolic moves.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tactical ideas</p>
<ul>
<li>Rates: Add duration (intermediate/long Treasuries) ahead of a cut‑into‑cuts sequence; consider steepeners.</li>
<li>Gold: Maintain an overweight; dips are buys into 2025.</li>
<li>Defense/Gov‑tech: Accumulate quality primes and software‑led integrators; rising multi‑year outlays and geopolitical premium.</li>
<li>Energy: Overweight midstream and select refiners; underweight high‑beta E&amp;Ps; hedge gas.</li>
<li>Tech: Barbell megacap AI platforms with “picks‑and‑shovels” in exchanges/data trading infra and select semicap; maintain exposure into Google’s next model release cycle.</li>
<li>Consumer: Near‑term favor discounters/grocers on SNAP timing risk; avoid airlines given shutdown/TSA friction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Watch calendar/catalysts</p>
<ul>
<li>Today: FOMC rate decision and Powell presser.</li>
<li>This week: Megacap tech earnings; Boeing follow‑through commentary.</li>
<li>Nov 1–15: Potential House vote on funding; shutdown resolution window.</li>
<li>November: Xi meeting; potential U.S.–China tariff framework headlines; TikTok transaction chatter.</li>
<li>Ongoing: Israel–Gaza ceasefire stability; EU Russia sanction package updates; hurricane season tail risks.</li>
</ul>
