<h2>Macro Outlook</h2>
<h3>Growth, Inflation, and Fed Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Baseline US GDP growth expectations for 2025 cluster in the 2–2.5% range, with minimal risk seen for either outsized expansion or outright recession.</li>
<li>Unemployment is expected to trend just above 4.2%, suggesting a slightly softening but still resilient labor market—modest pressure on wage inflation likely to persist.</li>
<li>Headline and core inflation are expected to remain entrenched above 3%, with limited probability of a surge above 4%. Wage growth is anticipated to stay ahead of inflation on average, supporting consumer discretionary sectors.</li>
<li>Multiple Fed rate cuts are implied as the base case for the year (three cuts most likely), with near-zero probability given to rate hikes or emergency cuts. This supports a constructive outlook for risk assets, with incremental tailwinds for both equities and long-duration bonds.</li>
<li>Government spending is likely to increase further in 2025, compounding fiscal deficit pressures. Total US debt is all but certain to be above $38T by year-end.</li>
<li>Macroeconomic policy risk from government shutdowns and looming political confrontations (debt ceiling, budget) remain acute short-term volatility drivers.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2nd/3rd Order Effects:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Persistent high government spending may keep upward pressure on yields and inflation expectations, while central bank dovishness may blunt the effects on risk assets.</li>
<li>Continued wage growth over inflation could underpin consumer spending resilience, especially in tech/consumer discretionary.</li>
<li>Gold's rally signals hedging against both inflation and geopolitical instability. Momentum flows into gold and related assets may further increase if macro or political risk escalates.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Thematic &amp; Sector Takeaways</h2>
<h3>Equities &amp; US Markets</h3>
<ul>
<li>S&amp;P 500 and major US indices are expected to preserve a strong upward bias, with high confidence in new yearly highs and end-2025 levels solidly above 6,500. Risk of a major drawdown appears low barring exogenous shocks.</li>
<li>Bullion moves, higher digital asset prices, and robust ETF inflows suggest ongoing strong demand for both risk and inflation-hedged assets.</li>
<li>Recession fears have faded, and the consensus is for stable expansion, supporting growth-at-a-reasonable-price and secular tech leadership themes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Climate</h3>
<ul>
<li>The probability of reaching global 2°C warming before 2050 is increasingly accepted, with energy consumption still led by oil and coal through 2030, and ongoing hurdles for large-scale renewables adoption.</li>
<li>US and EU are unlikely to meet medium-term climate goals, supporting modest renewable energy buildout (notably solar in the US), but with oil and coal entrenched globally.</li>
<li>Natural gas pricing risk is skewed higher, with a strong base of $3+ expected in 2025.</li>
<li>Expansion of nuclear for data/tech infrastructure (US military bases) is increasingly likely; second-order ramifications for utility, infrastructure, and tech hardware suppliers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology &amp; Innovation</h3>
<ul>
<li>AI remains the central theme, both as a driver of tech stock outperformance and as a regulatory/policy risk—OpenAI is favored to IPO sooner than peers; Google, Nvidia, and other AI leaders remain in focus for outsized returns and headline risk.</li>
<li>Semiconductor production, especially US-based, is projected for double-digit growth, reinforcing the structural bull case for supply chain and hardware names.</li>
<li>Anticipate ongoing debate over privacy, regulation, and product updates (especially from Google/Alphabet).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consumer &amp; Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consumer spending remains robust, as evidenced by high engagement in seasonal retail events and sustained earnings power.</li>
<li>In healthcare, a new Type 1 diabetes cure is seen as an outside chance before 2033; near-term sector focus is likely to remain on regular pharma innovation, weight loss drugs, and regulatory trends.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are all expected to make significant new highs in 2025, though runaway targets (e.g., BTC $1M) are not in view.</li>
<li>Downside for major cryptos is seen as limited for the coming year, with strong risk-on sentiment. Crypto flows may further benefit from any flare-up in inflation, financial repression, or geopolitical volatility.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Country &amp; Geopolitical Watch</h2>
<h3>US Political Risk</h3>
<ul>
<li>Highly public DOJ and National Guard activity, plus mention of potential Insurrection Act use, keep domestic stability in focus. Shutdown politics may drive additional volatility in rate markets and government-linked sectors.</li>
<li>Little expectation of a US recession, but fiscal/funding surprises could shift the macro narrative quickly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Political Landscape</h3>
<ul>
<li>France faces heightened political instability, which could ripple to EUR/USD and EU-focused assets.</li>
<li>No imminent threat seen in EU member exits, though continued regional risk could fuel further bouts of volatility or safe haven flows.</li>
<li>China’s economic catch-up to the US remains unlikely by 2030. Market attention likely to stay on high-profile events (trade deals, Taiwan risk) rather than regime change.</li>
<li>Israel-Gaza conflict and related geopolitical volatility may buoy commodity prices, notably energy.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Notable Individual Names</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia</strong> increasingly seen as the likely largest company by market cap at year-end, pointing to continued AI-driven tech outperformance.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft</strong> and <strong>Apple</strong> less favored for top spot, but still systemically important; Apple faces modest market share and pricing headwinds.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla</strong> subject to accelerating price competition—a &quot;cheaper&quot; Model Y signals margin risk, not just volume play; headlines reinforce the sector’s cost/pricing dilemma rather than robust demand.</li>
<li><strong>Blackrock</strong> earnings/watchlist: growing focus on digital assets, record AUM, robust net inflows, and private market expansion—revenues and performance fees to drive narrative.</li>
<li><strong>Google/Alphabet:</strong> Product/AI innovation (Gemini/Pixel), alongside antitrust and regulatory scrutiny, will be central to investor conversations next quarter.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Actionable Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Favor overweight allocations to US equities, especially tech and semiconductor names; maintain hedges against both inflation (gold, TIPS) and macro/geopolitical risk (commodities, cash).</li>
<li>Consider tactical energy positioning: exposure to oil/nat gas for stable/strong pricing, but limit broad renewables bets to strongest pure-plays given policy uncertainty.</li>
<li>Maintain moderate or opportunistic crypto exposure, prioritizing BTC/ETH/SOL with tight risk management.</li>
<li>Monitor for volatility catalysts from US fiscal showdowns, France/EU politics, and headline risk in the Middle East.</li>
