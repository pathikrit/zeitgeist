</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macroeconomic &amp; Policy Outlook</h2>
<h3>US Fiscal and Policy Trajectory</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Government Shutdown:</strong> Federal government shutdown materially impacting transportation and federal salaries. Prospective spending increases remain likely, as major spending cuts under Trump/Elon are seen as highly improbable. Large, sustained government deficits almost certain; further escalation to $38T+ in US debt by year-end is highly likely, with further increases under a Trump administration probable.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation &amp; Growth:</strong> Core inflation and headline CPI are expected to stay in the high-2%/mid-3% range – sticky above historical Fed targets. Wage growth is likely to modestly outpace inflation in the near term. The dominant economic outlook is a &quot;soft landing&quot; scenario: positive but subdued GDP growth (1.6–2.5%), with modest jobs expansion and high workforce participation.</li>
<li><strong>Federal Reserve &amp; Rates:</strong> Markets do not anticipate further rate hikes in 2025; expectations cluster around the possibility of multiple (likely 2–3) rate cuts as the baseline. Twelve-month forward rates should remain below 2024 peaks, supporting risk assets, but with long-term yield pressures from expansionary fiscal policy and large deficits.</li>
<li><strong>Recession Risks:</strong> A near-term (2025) US recession is seen as unlikely; medium-term probability increases somewhat by 2027. Global recession risk is elevated but not base case.</li>
</ul>
<h3>International Landscape</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tariffs &amp; Trade:</strong> Escalating protectionism—on China and nearly all major trading partners (including allies)—is a high-conviction outcome, with significant new tariffs in 2025–2026. This underpins higher input costs for manufacturers, greater supply chain localization (especially for semiconductors), and pressure on margins for globalized multinationals.</li>
<li><strong>Currency:</strong> The US dollar index may see downside volatility (sub-95 not out of the question), with pronounced weakness against the euro in some scenarios, but not a collapse.</li>
<li><strong>Commodities:</strong> Gold’s sharp rise to all-time highs signals investor anxiety over political risk and global conflict. Oil prices could see significant volatility—downside risk from macro softness, but with upside remaining unless global trade completely seizes up. Natural gas volatility expected to continue.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors to Watch</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Big Tech:</strong> AI remains the dominant secular theme; OpenAI, Nvidia, and other hyperscale players continue to drive capex and M&amp;A activity. Litigation and regulatory risk—especially around copyright and antitrust—are rising (Amazon and Live Nation, specifically, face antitrust headwinds; OpenAI faces meaningful liability/copyright threat).</li>
<li><strong>IPO Landscape:</strong> Speculation around OpenAI’s (likely) IPO ahead of Anthropic could inject further speculative fervor.</li>
<li><strong>Earnings Themes:</strong> Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta—expect an increased focus on AI product announcements, regulatory/antitrust scrutiny, privacy, and international operations. Apple’s hardware pipeline appears robust, including likely Macbook cellular rollout. No signs of near-term C-suite turnover at major platforms.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Renewables</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fossil Dominance Continues:</strong> Oil and coal remain key to global energy use through 2030; renewables grow but do not yet displace legacy sources. Solar capacity will expand meaningfully (US 40GW+ installations likely), but far short of most bullish projections.</li>
<li><strong>EV Market:</strong> US EV market share continues to climb, but short of a 50% threshold by 2030. Tesla pushes lower-cost models to offset sunsetting subsidies. Supply chain, regulatory, and global trade friction will keep the sector volatile.</li>
<li><strong>Natural Gas:</strong> Significant upside potential as supply-demand fluctuations persist. Watch for price spikes (above $4) amidst policy or weather shocks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials &amp; Crypto</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Banks &amp; Asset Managers:</strong> BlackRock and JPMorgan positioned to benefit as asset flows remain robust, especially into digital asset/alternative/ETF products. Elevated buyback and private credit activity; regulatory reform remains a persistent topic.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto Momentum:</strong> Bitcoin widely expected to sustain high levels, with room for new all-time highs (well above $100K, potentially $150K or more). Downside floor for 2025 appears firm above $70K barring extreme shocks. Ethereum similarly has strong momentum; $5,000+ levels increasingly likely, with less enthusiasm for exponential upside ($10K) in 2025.</li>
<li><strong>De-dollarization/EM FX:</strong> Emerging market currencies (MXN, BRL) at risk of further depreciation; USD/EUR parity off the table for now.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Pharma</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type 1 Diabetes Cure:</strong> A breakthrough by 2033 is considered unlikely; advances worth monitoring, but not investable in the short or medium term.</li>
<li><strong>Antitrust &amp; Pricing:</strong> Low probability for effective anti-monopoly or price control legislation; potential looming for increased tariff pressure and cost structure volatility for pharma.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Changes:</strong> Some risk to stocks on White House policy to use tariff revenues to fund food and healthcare programs, possibly straining margins.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Assets &amp; Catastrophe</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>REITs/Insurance:</strong> Low-to-moderate probability, but non-negligible, of major natural catastrophes (earthquake risk in California and Japan under 50% odds by 2035/2030, respectively). Not an imminent portfolio risk, but multi-asset investors should consider sector exposures.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Names &amp; Immediate Themes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI/Big Tech:</strong> OpenAI likely to encounter new lawsuits, regulatory actions, and potential IPO. Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google likely to raise AI/ML capex and partnerships. Amazon and Live Nation in the antitrust crosshairs.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla:</strong> Intense regulatory headwinds, fierce Chinese competition, accelerated new product launches and margin management are critical. Cheaper models roll out as subsidy tailwinds fade.</li>
<li><strong>Gold:</strong> Watch for continued flows into real assets/safe havens as political instability rises.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong> Favor upside positioning in major tokens; risk of extreme drawdown limited barring macro or regulatory shock.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br />
The next 6–12 months are best characterized by political and policy-driven volatility—elevated tariffs, persistent inflation, and ongoing AI-driven tech disruption. While severe downturn feels unlikely, asset prices will remain highly reactive to political headlines and international relations. Major themes: Large fiscal deficits, enduring inflationary pressure, secular tech/AI growth, global trade tension, and strong “safe haven” demand for gold and crypto. Defensive positioning in rate-sensitive assets (bonds/TIPS) needs to be actively managed. Remain vigilant for sudden geopolitical or regulatory shocks in both tech and energy.</p>
