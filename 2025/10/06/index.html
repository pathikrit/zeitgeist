<h2>1. Macro &amp; Policy Outlook</h2>
<h3>Economic Growth &amp; Inflation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consensus expects <strong>US GDP growth in 2025</strong> to be moderate, most likely in the 1.5%-2.5% range. This points to a stable, non-recessionary economic environment but without significant expansionary tailwinds.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation (CPI and core)</strong> is expected to linger above 3%, with a return to sub-2% inflation viewed as unlikely in the next year. Price pressures remain sticky, especially in services.</li>
<li><strong>Fed policy</strong> is not expected to pivot hawkishly: multiple rate cuts are expected in 2025, with three being the most likely scenario. Notably, markets are assigning almost no chance to either a rate hike or emergency rate cuts. This reflects low recession risk but recognition that persistent inflation calls for gradual easing, not abrupt shifts.</li>
<li>US <strong>government shutdown risk</strong> and looming mass layoffs highlight fiscal headwinds and policy-driven tail risk for economic activity, government contractors, and consumer sentiment.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Second-Order Effects</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed income: Duration risk remains; likely continued curve steepening unless inflation re-accelerates.</li>
<li>Equities: Growth and profit margins in rate-sensitive sectors may benefit from a slowly easing credit environment. High inflation sectors (commodities, energy) could see tailwinds if price increases remain entrenched.</li>
<li>USD: With US policy staying neutral-dovish, currency stability should persist, but watch for volatility if shutdown risk increases or if Japan/Europe shift fiscal/monetary stances.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global/Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Middle East:</strong> Potential for renewed instability exists with only marginal probability of mass population movements, but continued violence or negotiation impasse in Gaza could disrupt oil markets and defense contractors.</li>
<li><strong>France &amp; EU:</strong> Political instability in France, with repeat PM resignations, adds risk to Eurozone financials and may drive safe-haven flows into USD assets.</li>
<li><strong>Japan:</strong> Leadership turnover to an ultra-conservative, pro-stimulus PM is increasing bond yields amid fiscal concerns; potential for impact on global carry trades and cross-border flows.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2. Sector Outlook</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Hardware:</strong> AMD’s OpenAI deal signals sectoral leadership change and intensifying competition in the AI chip space. Capital flows are likely to chase AI and semiconductor names beyond Nvidia (already priced for dominance), with upside for suppliers/leaders in compute infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Mega Cap Tech:</strong> Nvidia remains strongly favored to keep its position as the world’s most valuable company for now; Microsoft and Apple have only limited prospects of unseating it in 2025. Succession plans at the helm of top tech giants (Google, Amazon, Apple) are steady, implying limited disruption risk.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials</h3>
<ul>
<li>Banking sector M&amp;A is accelerating, especially amongst regional banks, as seen with Fifth Third/Comerica. Expect increased consolidation and cost-cutting as banks seek to shore up scale in a higher-for-longer rate environment. Watch regional bank credit risk, especially if shutdown disrupts lending or government payment flows.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Retail &amp; Consumer</h3>
<ul>
<li>E-commerce growth is decelerating as consumers get more price sensitive. The sector will see less robust seasonal sales unless deep promotions materialize. AI-driven retail experiences (personalization, logistics) may offset margin pressure but real expansion appears muted.</li>
<li>Branded tech hardware (Apple, Google, Amazon smart devices) faces intensifying competition and slower upgrade cycles as consumer wallets tighten.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Alternative Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crypto</strong>: Bitcoin and Ethereum are expected to remain at elevated but not exuberant levels (Bitcoin likeliest to hover around $130,000, Ethereum $5,000-$6,000), with catastrophic upside/downside tails viewed as highly unlikely. Volatility is likely, but a crash back to previous cycle lows or a parabolic rise to &quot;moon&quot; targets both appear remote.</li>
<li>Traditional safe havens (gold, TIPS) may see steady interest as inflation remains above central bank targets but not spiking to crisis levels.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>3. Company-Specific Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia:</strong> Poised to maintain global top spot; continues to benefit from AI tailwinds, though colossally over-weighted expectations can set up for higher volatility.</li>
<li><strong>AMD:</strong> Breakout AI hardware deal is a sector disruptor; strong near-term momentum given OpenAI partnership news.</li>
<li><strong>Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon:</strong> Stability in leadership; market cap leadership unlikely to unseat Nvidia in the near-term.</li>
<li><strong>Verizon:</strong> CEO change signals potential for digital payment, fintech, or broader tech integration focus.</li>
<li><strong>Fifth Third/Comerica:</strong> Regional bank consolidation trend likely to persist, with M&amp;A offering some protection from credit/funding risks.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>4. Watch List / Emerging Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li>US government shutdown duration and federal workforce layoffs.</li>
<li>French and Japanese political shifts and their impacts on EUR, JPY and global rate volatility.</li>
<li>Unfolding developments in Gaza and oil market sensitivity to Middle East headlines.</li>
<li>AI hardware bottlenecks and competitive landscape—ripple effects across supply chains and software ecosystem.</li>
<li>Any signals of re-accelerating global inflation or abrupt central bank pivots.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br />
Current macro signals point to moderate US economic growth, sticky above-target inflation, and slow, measured monetary easing. Key market drivers are sectoral leadership transitions in AI hardware and ongoing banking sector consolidation. Political risk is rising in select global markets but near-term crisis outcomes are viewed as unlikely. Stay attuned to exogenous shocks (shutdown, Middle East, European politics) that could alter these paths.</p>
