<hr />
<h2>Macro Outlook</h2>
<h3>Fiscal Policy &amp; Shutdowns</h3>
<ul>
<li>US government shutdown risk is extremely elevated, with substantial probability of lasting more than several days. This is likely to delay the release of economic data, create near-term uncertainties, and may cause increased volatility or market pullbacks in sensitive sectors (e.g., defense, contractors, social services).</li>
<li>Significant US government spending increases expected for 2025, though the most dramatic spending hikes ($1 trillion+) are less likely. This points to continued deficit expansion and Treasury issuance, with probable upward pressure on yields—bearish for long-duration bonds.</li>
<li>US National Debt is tracking upwards, with a strong consensus for the debt surpassing $45 trillion and potentially reaching $50 trillion in coming years. Investors should remain cautious of long-duration sovereign debt and monitor inflation expectations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Monetary Policy &amp; Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li>No Fed rate hikes or emergency cuts are expected in 2025; a moderate chance of 3 cuts exists, but not beyond that. The market is not positioning for aggressive easing or tightening barring exogenous shocks.</li>
<li>Core and headline inflation are both anticipated to remain modestly above the Fed’s target (3-3.5%), reinforcing a &quot;higher-for-longer&quot; scenario. This creates a flat/steepening yield curve and sustains a valuation headwind for speculative equities and duration-sensitive assets.</li>
<li>No notable moves are expected in USD/JPY or EUR/USD, suggesting stability in major currency crosses for now, despite rising public debt and US policy volatility.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Labor Market &amp; Growth</h3>
<ul>
<li>US real wage growth is expected for 2025, which may help sustain consumer spending and support retail, discretionary, and services sectors.</li>
<li>Labor markets appear resilient, with consensus around unemployment rising only moderately (7-8%), not spiking to crisis-era highs.</li>
<li>GDP growth for 2025 is most likely to fall in the 2-2.5% range, well below boom levels. The prospect of recession is present but not dominant; however, government shutdown and prolonged uncertainty could push downside risk higher.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Asset Themes</h2>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li>The global energy mix is expected to remain dominated by oil and coal out to 2030, despite structural renewables growth and EU progress. Bottlenecks/slow progress in renewables transition can buoy fossil fuel and related infrastructure pricing, even amid high carbon awareness.</li>
<li>US is unlikely to meet its 2030 climate targets; EU's odds are balanced. This implies ongoing climate policy volatility, heightened regulatory risk, and increased demand for carbon capture/offset, resilience infrastructure, and insurance.</li>
<li>Higher long-run global temperatures likely, driving persistent demand for climate mitigation (insurance, catastrophe bonds, engineered infrastructure), and raising risks for agriculture, water, and climate-sensitive REITs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology &amp; IPO Markets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tech IPOs remain sporadic. Discord is viewed as a likely near-term entrant; Stripe, Brex, and OpenAI IPOs have moderate chances but nothing imminent.</li>
<li>Notably, Anduril (defense tech) is postured for an IPO ahead of most high-profile tech companies—reflecting investor interest in security, defense, and AI-enabled platforms.</li>
<li>Limited near-term activity from highly valued consumer/enterprise startups (Airtable, Glean, Deel), suggesting risk-off private capital markets or valuation hesitancy.</li>
<li>AI leadership models may not shift dramatically among major players (Anthropic, Meta, Alibaba, Nvidia) in the very near term.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Pharmaceuticals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Moderate chance of FDA approving a psychedelic medicine by 2027, potentially opening new subsectors in biotech/pharma and M&amp;A.</li>
<li>Trump administration’s discounted drug initiative with Pfizer is headline-grabbing and could pressure sector pricing and public insurance policy, with marginal second-order effects on PBMs, manufacturers' margins, and innovation incentives.</li>
<li>Drug pricing and regulatory powers are likely to remain active political topics into 2025 and beyond.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin is seen as likely to surpass $130k by year-end, with a moderate chance for even higher levels. The drawdown to old cycle lows is considered increasingly unlikely.</li>
<li>Institutional adoption is expected to expand further, with good odds that another S&amp;P 500 constituent adds BTC to treasury holdings this year.</li>
<li>Ethereum also retains strong upward expectations, with the market skewed bullish on reaching above $5k.</li>
<li>Crypto-related equities (miners, exchanges) may see above-market returns if adoption and sentiment remain robust.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Estate, Catastrophe, and Insurance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing focus on climate and catastrophe risk; while a major California earthquake in the very short term is less likely, the insurance sector could see pricing power and reinsurance demand rise due to global tail risks and regulatory climate changes.</li>
<li>Catastrophe events (recent Philippines quake) and persistent climate stress continue to drive demand for infrastructure resilience and specialized disaster recovery/mitigation plays.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Notable Individual Names and Dynamics</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elon Musk</strong>: Likelihood of Delaware Supreme Court moving in his favor is balanced, with high visibility of compensation packages and governance risk at Tesla and SpaceX. Starlink/SpaceX IPOs not expected this year.</li>
<li><strong>Tech CEOs</strong>: Incumbent leadership at Google (Pichai), Apple (Cook), Amazon (Jassy), OpenAI (Altman), and Coinbase (Armstrong) is secure for now; succession risk is not front-of-mind.</li>
<li><strong>S&amp;P 500 Outlook</strong>: Market is firmly biased toward a positive finish for 2025, with little expectation of a deep correction. Upside targets (6,600+) are probable; deep downside is not priced in.</li>
<li><strong>Live Nation</strong>: High chance of antitrust scrutiny/monopoly ruling, which could impact its business model and similar vertical-integration plays in other entertainment sectors.</li>
<li><strong>FTC/DOJ Antitrust</strong>: Ongoing activism, recently targeting Zillow, Redfin, Live Nation, and more—implies continued friction for platform consolidators.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Key Second &amp; Third Order Effects</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delay in Economic Data</strong>: The government shutdown could disrupt market visibility, potentially increasing volatility and delaying Fed or fiscal adjustments. This could temporarily strengthen USD as a defensive asset, while also impeding timely inflation/labor prints.</li>
<li><strong>Deficit &amp; Debt Ceiling</strong>: High government spending without rate hikes creates a backdrop of expanding debt/GDP for the US, which may eventually foster higher inflation expectations or market pressure for fiscal reform post-shutdown.</li>
<li><strong>Climate Risk Pricing</strong>: Persistent expectation of climate overshoot and policy delay suggests structural re-rating of insurance, agri-commodities, catastrophe and resilience-linked financial products. This is relevant for allocations to TIPS, resource/utility equities, and disaster-insurance linked securities.</li>
<li><strong>Tech/Defense Re-Rating</strong>: The speed of defense tech IPOs and increased militarization/geopolitical tensions can sustain a defense premium and M&amp;A uptick among government contractors and critical infrastructure suppliers.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto Market Integration</strong>: Institutional adoption trends for BTC/Ethereum, along with stable regulatory climate, suggests a continued pivot by asset managers toward digital exposure.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Tactical Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Remain defensive with duration and highly levered balance sheets as rates and debt continue to rise and the shutdown threatens economic clarity.</li>
<li>Consider climate/insurance plays, as both risk and government demand for resilience persist.</li>
<li>Selectively overweight tech names with real AI/defense exposure (Anduril) and those closest to IPO, but avoid overexposed unprofitable SaaS until capital market windows genuinely improve.</li>
<li>Healthcare/pharma faces both margin pressure from policy, but also upside from innovation (psychedelics, ongoing COVID/virus research).</li>
<li>Maintain crypto allocation, with an eye toward market structure risers (Coinbase, miners), but moderate position size as sentiment is vulnerable to further regulatory or market shocks.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>In summary:</strong><br />
Expect higher-for-longer rates, a contentious political and fiscal environment, upward trend in real assets and digital asset adoption, steady US consumer/labor strength, and sectoral opportunities in climate transition, defense tech, and resilience-linked finance. Allocate accordingly, with careful attention to macro and regulatory data flow interruptions ahead.</p>
