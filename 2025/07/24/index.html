<hr />
<h2>Macroeconomic &amp; Policy Outlook</h2>
<h3>US Macro/Market Cycle</h3>
<ul>
<li>The market anticipates modest but positive US GDP growth for 2025. Odds are highest for sub-2.5% real GDP prints, with stronger numbers seen as quite unlikely. Odds of a 2025 US recession remain elevated versus recent years, but confidence overall leans against an outright contraction.</li>
<li>Wage growth is expected to run just ahead of inflation, supporting consumer demand.</li>
<li>The S&amp;P 500 is widely expected to finish 2025 positive, with tails to the downside relatively contained.</li>
<li>Unemployment is projected to climb but remain manageable (~4–4.2% levels most likely), reflecting mild economic cooling rather than stress.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Second-Order Risks:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The very high S&amp;P optimism and suppressed volatility expectations leave the market vulnerable to policy surprises, global shocks, or sudden inflation shifts.</li>
<li>A government shutdown within 2025 remains a non-trivial possibility, which could halt spending programs, weigh on Q3–Q4 growth, and add near-term yields volatility.</li>
<li>Geopolitics (Middle East, Russia/Ukraine, Asia) continue to present tail event risk.</li>
</ul>
<h3>US Fiscal and Debt</h3>
<ul>
<li>Total US debt is on track to surpass $38T during 2025, with annual deficit reduction seen as unlikely.</li>
<li>US Treasury yields are expected to remain steady in the 4–4.5% range, with little market-implied risk of yield spikes.</li>
<li>Federal default risk is seen as remote but not zero—still worth hedging at the margin if political brinksmanship escalates.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Investment Implications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Persistent high deficits suggest increased upward pressure on long-term bond yields over time, but the yield curve is not pricing acute stress now.</li>
<li>With budgets strained, risk of “surprise” tax or spending policy changes is heightened in event of an economic/market shock.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fed, Inflation, and Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Fed is broadly expected to hold rates steady for 2025, with at most one or two rate cuts. A hike is viewed as extremely unlikely barring unexpected inflation.</li>
<li>High market agreement on rates presents risk if inflation surprises to the upside, or if global shocks force emergency easing.</li>
<li>Fed communications will emphasize dual mandates, spending, and tariffs—watch for policy inflections post-election.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Second-Order/Asset Flows:</h4>
<ul>
<li>With limited rate volatility expected, bond market positioning will focus more on inflation break-evens and credit risk/policy signals than dramatic duration moves.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trade &amp; Tariffs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Trump’s first-year tariff push is near-certain; China and semiconductors are clear targets. Tariffs on copper and even pharma have a strong chance of implementation.</li>
<li>Probability of US exiting WTO or new forced trade shocks is low but rising.</li>
<li>Resulting supply chain cost pressures could stoke sector-specific US inflation and shift capital expenditure back to onshoring themes.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Key Sector &amp; Thematic Takeaways</h2>
<h3>Tech &amp; Semiconductors</h3>
<ul>
<li>Robust US semiconductor production growth expected in 2025 (mid-high single-digit percent/ramp), despite looming tariffs on both chips and raw inputs.</li>
<li>Tech is a market leadership sector (Alphabet earnings strength just reaffirmed this), but regulatory risk remains – Trump’s AI order and occasional policy threats to social media and hardware manufacturers could add headline risk.</li>
<li>Large cap platforms look resilient, but small caps could see higher volatility as focus on AI “fairness” and “wokeness” policies brings uncertainty.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Oil complex signals pronounced volatility: spot WTI likely to fluctuate broadly, with current bias toward mild downside. Low-$60s/bbl possible by year-end, but spikes toward $80/bbl (if OPEC or geopolitics flare up) remain plausible.</li>
<li>Gasoline prices in states like Texas and California may face periodic spikes ($3+ and $5+, respectively), but national averages should be manageable for the consumer.</li>
<li>Renewables: US and EU are unlikely to meet 2030 climate/decarbonization targets, reinforcing incremental investment over radical transformation in energy/utility sectors. Solar and Tesla’s energy business should see sustained but not explosive growth; expect targets to be revised, not met.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials</h3>
<ul>
<li>JPMorgan CEO succession attracts attention; continuity expected with internal candidates. No acute destabilization risk.</li>
<li>UnitedHealth’s federal probe clouds the healthcare insurance space. Be alert to competitors’ legal exposure and DOJ’s shifting focus.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Pharma</h3>
<ul>
<li>Healthcare costs/features are in political crosshairs: movement to repeal/alter ACA is non-trivial, especially post-election, but not imminent.</li>
<li>Pricing power in high-profile drugs like Ozempic could ebb in coming quarters, though aggressive price collapses look unlikely.</li>
<li>Near-term FDA approvals for key names (e.g., Donidalorsen, Sebetralstat) support selective biotech allocation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Estate</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rent inflation is projected to be persistent in major metros like San Francisco (&gt;2%) and New York (up to mid-single digits), with SF more robust and NYC showing mixed signals.</li>
<li>Risk trend: Potential for earthquake scenarios, especially in California, calls for strategic hedges or avoidance in highly levered REITs and insurance plays.</li>
<li>Broader REIT outlook supported by steady wage/inflation growth but vulnerable if rates surprise higher.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Industrials &amp; Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tariffs on copper/metals are highly likely, which may lift input volatility for US manufacturers and spur more near-term inflation in materials-heavy sectors.</li>
<li>Defense spending and energy infrastructure are not flagged for cuts, and could see cyclical benefit in the event of further global turmoil.</li>
</ul>
<h3>EVs &amp; Autos</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tesla outlook muted: weak sales, price discounting, and fading EV demand identified in news and markets; rapid expansion through new affordable models or energy milestones not anticipated in 2025–2026.</li>
<li>ICE/hybrid launches by Tesla are highly unlikely, suggesting sector pressure if EV malaise persists. EV supply chain and battery plays require more scrutiny for margin compression and competitive threats.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Noteworthy Individual Names</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tesla:</strong> Facing multiple headwinds – weak Q2, limited product/driven upside short-term, and broader EV demand fatigue.</li>
<li><strong>Alphabet/Google:</strong> Driving tech/market sentiment up; earnings leadership persists.</li>
<li><strong>UnitedHealth:</strong> Under DOJ investigation; material headline and litigation risk for entire managed care space.</li>
<li><strong>JPMorgan:</strong> CEO transition viewed as stable; no adverse succession shock expected.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Potential Geopolitical &amp; Black Swan Watchlist</h2>
<ul>
<li>Escalating Middle East/Gaza humanitarian disaster poses headline oil/geopolitical risk.</li>
<li>Renewed Russia–Ukraine drone attacks maintain global supply chain and risk premium.</li>
<li>Thailand–Cambodia border crisis could trigger EM risk tightening.</li>
<li>Ghislaine Maxwell/Jeffrey Epstein dossier drama fuels unpredictable US political volatility, possible regulatory pivots.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Summary/Actionable View</h3>
<p><strong>Maintain a pro-risk stance, but manage exposures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep allocations to tech/semis strong but hedged for tariff shocks and regulatory volatility.</li>
<li>Healthcare and REITs are at risk from regulatory and headline shocks—watch for entry points if sector overreacts.</li>
<li>Favor US-centric supply chains and industrials that can benefit from domestic capex and onshoring.</li>
<li>Monitor fiscal/bond headlines and have liquidity/cash alternatives for political standoffs or debt ceiling noise.</li>
<li>Maintain inflation hedges, but expect slow downward drift barring new exogenous shocks.</li>
<li>Watch for idiosyncratic earnings/DOE/FDA events for high-quality single-name opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remain nimble and watch headlines for sudden policy/geopolitical dislocations that could quickly alter sector outlooks.</strong></p>
