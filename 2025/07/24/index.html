</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Markets</h2>
<h3>US Economic Outlook</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growth &amp; Risk:</strong> Odds strongly support the US avoiding recession this year (and into 2025). However, the consensus is for slow/moderate GDP growth (~1.5-2%); robust growth (“Trump boom”) is considered plausible but not dominant.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market:</strong> Unemployment is projected to drift higher, but odds of a severe spike (e.g., over 9%) remain modest. Expect some weakness reflected in higher unemployment but not an acute jobs crisis in the near term.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Headline and core CPI are both likely to stay in the upper-2% to mid-3% range into late summer and possibly above 3% into 2025. US inflation, while not runaway, is resistant to rapid normalization.</li>
<li><strong>Monetary Policy:</strong> Multiple Fed cuts this year are still more likely than not, but the outlook for aggressive easing has diminished. Expect 1-2 cuts at most, conditional on inflation easing; no sign of a return to ZIRP.</li>
<li><strong>Debt &amp; Fiscal Policy:</strong> US national debt will pass $38 trillion by year-end with very high likelihood. This, combined with sticky inflation and elevated yields (10Y seen above 4.6%), signals continued supply-driven pressure on Treasuries and upward risk to risk-free rates.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2nd/3rd Order Effects</h4>
<ul>
<li>Inflation pressure + higher-for-longer yields could support continued leadership by real asset sectors (commodities, energy, real estate with pricing power).</li>
<li>Fiscal expansion and higher rates may begin to pressure housing, leveraged consumers, small-cap equities, and unprofitable tech in due course.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics &amp; Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ukraine / Russia:</strong> Little expectation of ceasefire or major regime change; risk premium remains for energy/agriculture, but tail event of sudden détente is discounted.</li>
<li><strong>Middle East / Iran:</strong> Leadership and regional balance changes unlikely in immediate term; energy/defense positioning more stable but vigilant for shocks.</li>
<li><strong>Climate &amp; Regulation:</strong> US regulatory climate facing potential reversal, especially around emissions and automotive rules. Factors to watch: carbon sector stocks, auto efficiency trade.</li>
<li><strong>Asia:</strong> Thailand-Cambodia skirmish underlines Southeast Asia’s geopolitical fragility; possible supply risks for select mineral/agriculture/tech value chains.</li>
<li><strong>China/Europe:</strong> Trade negotiations remain tense, with rare earths and climate commitments in focus.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2nd/3rd Order Effects</h4>
<ul>
<li>US regulatory retrenchment on climate could drive underweighting of “clean tech” and ESG-thematic stocks, benefit traditional energy/utilities and auto upstarts that can exploit new loopholes.</li>
<li>Ongoing US-China/EU friction to benefit alternate sourcing countries (e.g., Vietnam, India) and support select US/EU industrials.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Strategy</h2>
<h3>Tech &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mega-cap Tech Domination:</strong> Nvidia is widely expected to be the world’s largest public company by year-end, with Microsoft trailing. AI and semiconductor momentum to persist. Software (especially cloud, AI-focused) and leading hardware names to retain premium multiples.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory/Antitrust:</strong> Emerging risk for major platforms (Meta, Alphabet), but odds of forced breakups or major structural penalties this year are minimal.</li>
<li><strong>AI Product Cycle:</strong> Major new model (GPT-5) release is highly likely this year. Key sub-themes: AI infrastructure, cloud spend, and hardware (Nvidia, AMD, Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud).</li>
<li><strong>Big Tech Earnings:</strong> Expect recurring focus on AI/Gen AI, cloud, subscription models, and operating margin enhancement. Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla to remain AI narrative beneficiaries, barring idiosyncratic regulatory or product failures.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla:</strong> Key “earnings call” topics include autonomy, AI software/robotics (Dojo, Optimus, Robotaxi), tariffs, new affordable EVs, and regulatory maneuvering. Short-term volatility expected due to execution and demand questions.</li>
<li><strong>Apple:</strong> Expected to lean into wearable, AI, China manufacturing, and service revenues. No near-term breakthrough hardware cycle (e.g., no foldable iPhone).</li>
</ul>
<h4>2nd/3rd Order Effects</h4>
<ul>
<li>Persistent narrow leadership (“Magnificent 7” share remains high in S&amp;P 500), with limited market breadth.</li>
<li>AI regulation/safety bills not seen as a near-term headwind; watch for possible catalyst if enacted.</li>
<li>Semiconductor cyclicality still a risk; supply chain shocks from Asia/EM always a background concern.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy, Commodities, Crypto</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy:</strong> Ongoing geopolitical friction (Russia/Ukraine, Middle East) maintains risk premium, but energy rallies likely to be moderate unless escalation occurs.</li>
<li><strong>Commodities:</strong> Sticky inflation and real asset demand (gold, metals, rare earths) supported by fiscal expansion and inconsistent supply chains.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong> Bitcoin and Ethereum after a volatile 2024-25, with base case further upside for both through year-end (BTC $130K seen plausible; ETH to new highs slightly favored, Cardano ETF likely approved). Lower but non-negligible downside tail risk for “crypto winter.”</li>
</ul>
<h4>2nd/3rd Order Effects</h4>
<ul>
<li>Blockchain-based US Treasury transactions could provide fintech tailwinds but not a near-term market mover.</li>
<li>Outperformance opportunity may shift from BTC/ETH toward “real economy-linked” assets (energy, ag, gold) if CPI/Fed path turns more hawkish.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Autos &amp; Industrials</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Autos:</strong> US-Japan trade deal, plus relaxed climate policy, likely benefit foreign automakers and traditional US OEMs. Tesla faces visibility gap as it transitions to affordable EVs amidst regulatory and competitive pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Industrials:</strong> SpaceX commercial launches remain robust, underscoring leadership in new space sector.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Names To Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia (NVDA):</strong> Retains AI/semiconductor leadership narrative; growth focus on gaming, automotive, sovereign/robotic themes. Most likely to maintain top market cap slot. Sensitive to GPU/AI infra spending, possible China shocks.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla (TSLA):</strong> Near-term bearish on “rough patch” warning and sales worry, watch for execution of “affordable model,” and regulatory/AI headlines (especially tariffs and automation).</li>
<li><strong>Apple (AAPL):</strong> Growth drivers in wearables, services, stable product cycle; watch for margin effect from tariffs/China supply chain.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft (MSFT):</strong> Cloud, AI/collaboration (Copilot, Azure, Teams, OpenAI) continue to drive performance. M&amp;A/Activision integration minor headline risk.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon (AMZN):</strong> AI, AWS, Prime membership content remain themes; supply chain, tariff, and margin focus.</li>
<li><strong>Alphabet (GOOG):</strong> Key focus on AI (Gemini/YouTube Shorts/Cloud), antitrust litigation, and data center scaling.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Risk Monitor</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Tail Risks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Major geoevent (meteor strike, nuclear detonation) not central base case but justification for hedges (volatility, gold, defense, selected tail-risk insurance).</li>
<li>Marketwide circuit breaker risk present but not dominant.</li>
<li>US debt ceiling/default risk is extremely muted for this year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Global Policy:</strong> Monitor for rapid US fiscal or regulatory pivots, new international sanctions or regime changes, and surprise in Asian markets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Summary Investment Lean</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stay overweight in US mega-cap tech/AI leaders, with selective tilt into quality energy/commodity plays and real asset hedges.</li>
<li>Retain strategic exposure to core crypto (BTC, ETH), adding/lowering on structural volatility.</li>
<li>Watch for rotation into traditional sectors (energy, autos, select industrials) if US policy unwinds on climate or tariffs.</li>
<li>Maintain risks controls for high-volatility events and idiosyncratic geopolitical shocks, but no urgent need for broad de-risking.</li>
<li>Monitor inflation/rate shock risk for late-cycle impact on consumer and small/mid-cap stocks.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Remain attentive to evolving regulatory themes (AI, trade, climate), Fed policy signals, and headline risks affecting major individual names and sectors.</p>
