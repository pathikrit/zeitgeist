<h1>Daily Memo (24-Jul-2025)</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Key News &amp; Macro Developments</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>US political/legal volatility intensifies:</strong> Trump-linked controversies (Epstein files, DOJ subpoenas, Supreme Court rulings on regulatory appointments), more direct White House control over regulatory agencies; DOJ increasingly a tool in high-profile political disputes.</li>
<li><strong>Trump signals full AI deregulation:</strong> Multiple executive orders target &quot;woke&quot; AI, copyright, and state AI rules, aiming to accelerate US leadership in the AI race.</li>
<li><strong>US-Japan 15% auto tariff deal announced:</strong> US automakers express concern about competitive disadvantage; market participants parsing second-order impacts on global supply chains and US consumer prices.</li>
<li><strong>Russia-Ukraine peace talks resume:</strong> No ceasefire, but movement in rhetoric. In Ukraine, new anti-corruption policy triggers domestic backlash and protests.</li>
<li><strong>UN court climate ruling:</strong> Top court says nations may face legal liability for CO₂ emissions/failure to act, introducing real potential for cross-border litigation and reparations.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla earnings miss:</strong> Sharpest revenue drop in over a decade; 16% profit decline even amid leadership focus, but &quot;cheaper model&quot; targeted for 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Google (Alphabet) outperforms:</strong> Q2 earnings/revenue above expectations, significant increase in capex guidance tied to AI infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Meme stock mania returns:</strong> Krispy Kreme, GoPro, Beyond Meat surge; retail (mostly retail trading) speculation risk back in focus.</li>
<li><strong>Oil/gas prices volatile:</strong> Texas gas above $3 seen as likely; California remains high. WTI oil forecast: strong odds for wide price swings ($50–90).</li>
<li><strong>Global food insecurity crisis:</strong> Growing mass starvation in Gaza, increased humanitarian focus that could prompt new policy action/aid and secondary commodity price effects.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>1. Macro &amp; US Market Outlook</h2>
<h3>Fiscal &amp; Monetary Policy, Inflation, and Debt</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Continued large fiscal expansion:</strong> Government spending likely to increase significantly in 2025 (&gt; $500B), despite political rhetoric about cuts. Deficit unlikely to shrink compared to last year, and national debt to top $38T by year-end, with substantial longer-term growth (expectation of at least $40T within a few years; $45–50T plausible with current policy trajectory).</li>
<li><strong>Higher structural inflation risk:</strong> 2025 inflation expected to stay at or above 3%, with moderate probability of prints over 4%. Core inflation in the 3–4% range, implying sticky price growth that may limit the Fed's ability to pivot dovish. August CPI/CPIs also indicate inflation persistence.</li>
<li><strong>Recession risk moderate, not dominant:</strong> US recession probability through 2025 remains muted (roughly 1-in-6 odds); risk is more pronounced in Europe, UK, Japan.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Strategy Implications</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long-dated Treasurys and TIPS have ongoing vulnerability from both deficit/debt ceiling policy risk and persistent inflation.</li>
<li>Despite high deficit and looming fiscal challenges, market appears moderately constructive on broad equities for year-end but with growing downside tail risk.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Unemployment &amp; Labor Market</h3>
<ul>
<li>US unemployment is likely to remain in the 6%–9% band before 2030, with notable risk of higher levels if negative macro shocks materialize.</li>
<li>Tech sector layoffs are likely to increase y/y in 2025 — contributes to continued wage moderation but may weigh on consumer confidence.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2. Global, Geopolitical &amp; Policy Risk</h2>
<h3>US Politics &amp; Regulation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Intensified use of the regulatory state and executive power by the Trump administration, especially around deregulatory moves (AI, environment) and direct control of appointments. Legal battles between federal/state and executive/legislative branches likely to drive volatility especially in &quot;regulated&quot; sectors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Trade &amp; Tariffs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elevated trade barrier risk:</strong> Highly likely that Trump imposes new or expanded tariffs, especially targeting copper and autos. Revenue from tariffs on track to increase, with significant knock-on effects for supply chains, input costs, and corporate margins in trade-exposed sectors.</li>
<li><strong>New US-Japan auto tariff deal impacts:</strong> Immediate first-order effect is heightened risk for US automakers versus Asian competitors; potential for strategic retaliation or realignment in global sourcing.</li>
<li><strong>Trade deficit and dealmaking:</strong> Odds are balanced whether the trade deficit is halved, but new trade agreements this year (with countries like Canada, Vietnam, Japan, Israel) appear probable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Climate Policy, International Law</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>UN court ruling on climate reparations:</strong> Large emitters, resource extraction, and higher-profile publicly-listed polluters may face a real risk (not just theoretical) of cross-border litigation and damages. Watch for increased legal provisioning and disclosure from energy, metals/mining, and industrial majors.</li>
<li><strong>US/EU climate goals:</strong> US and EU are unlikely to meet 2030 targets, while India is more likely to succeed. Near-term: limited support for deep energy transition investments in developed markets; emerging market renewables and transition metals demand looks more robust.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>3. Sectors</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI deregulation:</strong> US tech mega-caps (especially Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft) likely benefit from loosened regulation, but policy risk persists as parties jockey over model outcomes and IP/copyright. Substantial incremental capex (see Alphabet’s guidance).</li>
<li>Top 2025 AI model leadership: xAI, Google, Deepseek, Anthropic, Meta at the front. Nvidia may play as an infrastructure/arms supplier, but not a direct leader in models.</li>
<li>Tech firms may consider reincorporation/move outside Delaware for legal or tax optimization, but expectation for mass flight is low.</li>
<li>Tech layoff wave will impact software, hardware, and cloud wage pressures, with secondary effect on real estate/consumption.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Autos, Manufacturing</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>EV penetration:</strong> ~30% market share in 2030 nearly assured, 50% less likely. Slower transition could benefit legacy auto with diversified fuel exposure in the near-to-mid term.</li>
<li><strong>Auto tariffs:</strong> US OEMs under pressure; trade deals (esp. with Japan) may favor Asian peers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy, Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commodities:</strong> Oil and gas prices remain highly volatile, with large swings possible; downside risks for oil look more likely than price spikes in the near term.</li>
<li><strong>Primary energy mix:</strong> Coal is likely to remain the dominant global source through 2030, limiting near-term upside for renewables pure-plays.</li>
<li><strong>Natural gas:</strong> Strong upside in price seen over 2025; expect $3–4+ as likely bands.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Pharma</h3>
<ul>
<li>Drug pricing pressure sustained: Insulin and Ozempic price declines likely, but no sector-changing deflation yet. Innovation catalyst (e.g., Type 1 diabetes cure) not imminent.</li>
<li>Policy-driven margin risk persists, especially for high-profile/expensive therapies.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Estate</h3>
<ul>
<li>NYC rent growth likely to remain at or near 5% y/y; strong rental markets in major cities but cap rates may adjust higher if rates/inflation persist.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Media, Retail, &amp; Entertainment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Corporate governance/leadership risk rises in a few bellwethers (Target, AMC).</li>
<li>Meme stock phenomenon returns, increasing speculative excess — monitor for volatility contagion.</li>
<li>Antitrust risks intensify (Live Nation, Apple, Amazon).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>4. Public Companies &amp; Individual Names</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tesla:</strong> Weak results; delivery guidance intact but revenue/profit margin under pressure. CEO succession risk exists but is not imminent.</li>
<li><strong>Alphabet (GOOGL):</strong> Growth driven by AI/infra spend; market rewarding execution and capital intensity, but longer-term regulatory risk remains.</li>
<li><strong>Meta, Apple, Amazon:</strong> Face meaningful antitrust scrutiny/enforcement risk this cycle, with elevated chances of seeing monopoly findings by 2030.</li>
<li><strong>JPMorgan:</strong> CEO succession increasingly relevant; Lake and Rohrbaugh lead as successors.</li>
<li><strong>Live Nation, Apple, Amazon:</strong> Courts likely to rule as monopolies before 2030, with real impact on sector structure and margins.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Notable Opportunities &amp; Risks (Second-Order Effects)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Persistent deficits/inflation = support for hard assets, infrastructure, and sectors with pricing power. But beware rate shock to duration-sensitive plays (long bonds, some REITs).</li>
<li>Tech megacaps stand to gain near-term from US regulatory holiday (AI/data/export), but should be watched for backlash if policy whiplash returns.</li>
<li>Supply chain realignment likely as new tariffs/trade deals proliferate, possibly benefiting US/Mexico/India manufacturing at the margin.</li>
<li>Energy transition delays in US/EU increase relative attractiveness of conventional energy/materials outside core ESG universes, while transition metals (copper, lithium) see renewed bid from India/emerging market demand and tariff-related dynamics.</li>
<li>Heightened legal risk for global polluters as climate litigation regime takes hold; insurance and risk-mitigation costs likely rise for exposed companies/countries.</li>
<li>Meme stock rallies may precede/warn of broader retail exuberance or volatility shocks — monitor listed companies seeing unusual options or social sentiment spikes.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Watchlist:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Treasury market and long-duration asset price sensitivity to headline inflation + spending data.</li>
<li>Defensive positioning in sectors with exposure to tariffs and policy swings (autos, big box retail, consumer discretionary).</li>
<li>Legal developments in antitrust for big tech; direct impacts to margin outlook in the next 1–3 years.</li>
<li>Policy signals from major G7 and EU economies — particularly on trade, currency, and environmental lawsuits.</li>
</ul>
