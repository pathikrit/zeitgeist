<h1>Daily Memo (30-Jul-2025)</h1>
<h2>Top News Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Major Tsunami Risks:</strong> 8.8 magnitude quake off Russia generated tsunami advisories for California, Japan, Hawaii, and Siberia; key infrastructure and insurance risk.</li>

<li><strong>Fed Policy in Focus:</strong> Fed expected to stand pat despite political pressure; potential for internal division as economic and political tensions mount.</li>
<li><strong>Extreme Heat in US:</strong> Eastern US experiencing record wet-bulb temperatures and deadly heat dome; infrastructure, utilities, and insurance impact rising.</li>
<li><strong>Climate Policy Shift:</strong> EPA proposes rescinding the Clean Air Act’s legal basis for carbon regulation, rolling back emissions rules.</li>
<li><strong>Starbucks &amp; UnitedHealth Weakness:</strong> Starbucks profits plunge on turnaround costs. UnitedHealth Group issues weak 2025 outlook as insurance costs spike.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Policy</h2>
<h3>US Economy &amp; Debt</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recession Risk:</strong> Odds favor the US avoiding recession in 2025, though significant risk remains into 2027. Growth for 2025 is expected to be moderate (most likely 1.5%-2.5%).</li>
<li><strong>Debt Expansion:</strong> US federal debt expected to exceed $38T by year-end; fiscal expansion remains the norm, with little probability of meaningful deficit reduction.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation &amp; Rates:</strong> Inflation for 2025 is unlikely to return above 5%; core and headline readings both expected in the 2.5%-4% range. Fed unlikely to cut rates aggressively, which supports elevated but stable yields.</li>
<li><strong>Trade Policy:</strong> Very high probability of broad-based tariff hikes, especially targeting China, South Korea, Taiwan, Mexico, Canada, Europe, and even Brazil. Expect global trade tensions to escalate, potentially driving up import prices and causing supply chain friction.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market:</strong> While outlier risks for double-digit unemployment are low, expect some softness—unemployment likely to climb moderately near 4% by late summer, with fewer blockbuster jobs reports.</li>
<li><strong>Wage Growth:</strong> Wages likely to barely keep pace or modestly outstrip inflation, supporting moderate consumption but not driving new inflation waves.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Risks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Currency Movements:</strong> Key currencies (EUR, MXN) under pressure—dollar strength not assured, but far from vulnerable to collapse. Notable devaluation risk for the Mexican peso.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitics:</strong> Ongoing military/diplomatic risk in the Middle East, Ukraine, and potentially Taiwan. Notable news: no breakthrough in Russia/Ukraine ceasefire and new UK policy could shift Mideast alignments.</li>
<li><strong>Climate &amp; Disaster:</strong> Policy pullbacks on US climate regulation may impact longer-term emissions trends and investment patterns; near-term, energy/utility demand is stoked by severe US heat waves.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Asset Class Implications</h2>
<h3>Equities &amp; Broad Indices</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Outlook:</strong> Major US indices (S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq) remain on track for positive growth by year-end. While upside is capped (unlikely to break above 7,000 S&amp;P/24,500 Nasdaq), downside tails remain contained short-term, with low risk of marketwide circuit-breaker events.
<ul>
<li><strong>2nd Order:</strong> Tariffs and supply chain disruptions could lead to sharp rotation among sectors, benefiting domestic plays (utilities, infrastructure, select technology/hardware) over global cyclicals and multinationals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Volatility:</strong> Market may exhibit bouts of volatility on trade, Fed, or geopolitical news, but systemic panic is not the base case.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rates, Commodities &amp; FX</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed Income:</strong> Policy rates likely to remain elevated, with only modest odds of rate cuts—even fewer chances of emergency cuts—limiting price upside for long-duration bonds.</li>
<li><strong>Energy:</strong> Tariffs, climate regulation changes, and extreme weather all feed uncertainty. Oil prices range-bound with asymmetric downside risk through year-end; gas prices to remain elevated, especially in California.</li>
<li><strong>Commodities:</strong> Tariffs on copper and possible disruptions for other metals may cause increased volatility and price spikes in select inputs; watch industrials and global supply chain stocks.</li>
<li><strong>USD Strength:</strong> The US dollar likely to hold up vs. key peers, though not without periodic volatility; major de-dollarization (USD below 90 DXY) remains an outside scenario.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong> Major upside in Bitcoin and Ethereum considered plausible but not the central expectation; further rallies above $130,000 (BTC) and $4,500 (ETH) possible but vulnerable to pullbacks, headline risks (stablecoin issues, regulatory action).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sectors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technology:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Semiconductors:</strong> Strong US manufacturing growth in chips expected to continue, but supply chains remain at risk if tariffs broaden. South Korea and Taiwan particularly exposed.</li>
<li><strong>Big Tech Leadership:</strong> Nvidia increasingly likely to assume largest US company spot, surpassing Microsoft and Apple—reflecting AI/data-center investment conviction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Insurers face margin pressure (see UnitedHealth), and large-scale regulatory/political changes are not currently imminent.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer:</strong> Moderate wage gains and stable labor backdrop support resilience, but input costs, consumer credit, and tariffs require watchfulness.</li>
<li><strong>Clean Energy &amp; Utilities:</strong> Policy headwinds as EPA pursues rollback of carbon rules; however, solar and infrastructure deployment continues at a slower but positive pace.</li>
<li><strong>Defense:</strong> War risks remain elevated, with ongoing procurement flows for US defense contractors. European and Asian defense sectors face currency, trade, and policy noise.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>REITs:</strong> Disaster risk to California, insurance pricing, and climate extremes could be sector headwinds, offset somewhat by yield-seeking flows.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Names &amp; Key Themes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia</strong>: Most likely to be the world’s top company by market cap end-2025; AI and semiconductor exposure remain core leadership themes.</li>
<li><strong>Apple/Microsoft</strong>: Unlikely to retake global top slot; watch for impact of hardware refresh cycles, macro sensitivity on earnings, and regulatory headlines.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla, Alphabet, Meta</strong>: Well-positioned sector-wise, but less likely to reclaim global leadership; regulatory and competitive pressures weigh.</li>
<li><strong>Major Insurers (UnitedHealth, etc.)</strong>: Challenged by rising costs, weather risk, and ongoing political scrutiny—margin compression likely.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Majors</strong>: Subject to swings from both regulatory action and weather/geopolitical shocks.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Watchlist: Potential Sources of Tail Risk</h2>
<ul>
<li>Catastrophic earthquakes (Japan, California) or extreme weather events trigger insurance, infrastructure, and property market dislocations well beyond local effects, impacting broader financials and commodities.</li>
<li>Hot currency devaluations—especially MXN and secondary emerging markets—could spill into global risk-off moves.</li>
<li>Further escalation of US/China/EU trade friction could amplify sector rotation and disrupt earnings for multinationals.</li>
<li>Middle East stalemate/faltering Israel–Western relations could feed defense, energy, and humanitarian volatility.</li>
<li>Unanticipated Fed policy shift (internal dissent, political interference) or sudden large-scale market event (NYSE circuit breaker, crypto collapse) could provoke sharp, temporary re-pricing across risk assets.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>In summary:</strong> Macro remains supportive but fraught with headline and policy tail risks; US equities retain moderate upside, with rotation expected amid global turbulence. Tariffs, climate, and currency themes drive cross-asset positioning needs, while technology, US manufacturing, and defense persist as relative sector leaders. Stay alert to second-order effects from currency swings, supply chain disruptions, and policy pivots, especially heading into election and budget cycles.</p>
