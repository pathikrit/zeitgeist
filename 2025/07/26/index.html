<hr />
<h2>1. Macro / Global Themes</h2>
<h3>a. US Fiscal, Trade, and Rate Outlook</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tariffs &amp; Trade Policy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Trump’s strong probability of launching significant tariffs in 2025 (including on copper) implies a stagflation risk, supply chain rerouting, higher input prices (esp. commodities, semis/tech, autos, industrials).</li>
<li>US trade talks with the EU and Japan are increasingly zero-sum, with allies scrutinizing US reliability; expect choppy FX and volatility in trade-exposed multinational earnings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>US Fiscal Position:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Additional major increases in US federal spending and debt are very likely through 2025 and beyond, with the debt ceiling almost certain to be raised.</li>
<li>Upward pressure on Treasury supply, lingered higher yields across the curve, risk of credit rating discussion and potential for term premium pressure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Labor &amp; Inflation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>US unemployment expected to drift up toward/beyond 4%; labor market cooling, with persistent white-collar/tech layoffs accelerating.</li>
<li>Core and headline inflation expected to remain in the 3–4% range for 2025, well above Fed target. Disinflation is likely to be slow, especially with sticky input costs (energy, tariffs, wages).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fed:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Market expects at least one to two rate cuts in 2025, but a sudden lurch to aggressive easing is unlikely barring crisis. Watch for curve steepening if inflation stays resilient but growth slips.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>b. Global/Geo-Political Risk</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Japan:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Expected near-term leadership change may introduce more JPY volatility and policy unpredictability, with implications for global capital flows and risk hedging.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>EU:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Modest possibility of a member leaving the EU before 2030, with Hungary or Italy as the likely sources of drama—an undercurrent for EUR volatility and spikes in sovereign spreads.</li>
<li>EU enlargement prospects support longer-term optimism for integration but create new political complexities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>China:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Chinese economy is unlikely to surpass US in size by 2030, but rivalry will intensify. US tariffs and tech restrictions (esp. semis) will continue to re-route supply chains and create sector winners/losers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2. Sectors / Major Asset Classes</h2>
<h3>a. Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil &amp; Gas:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Near-term: Downward pressure on WTI oil is suggested into late 2025, likely keeping prices below mid-$60s/bbl for a protracted period. Natural gas prices likely to stay high (above $4/mmbtu).</li>
<li>2nd-order: Tariffs on copper and general resource nationalism will keep commodity trade flows volatile and create winners among domestic/near-shored producers.</li>
<li>Medium-term: Coal and oil remain key global energy sources through 2030, suggesting a tailwind for traditional energy sector, although transitions to new energy and regulatory overhangs remain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Metals:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Copper in focus for new tariffs (watch for cost passthrough and relative outperformance of non-US suppliers).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>b. Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Platforms:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Dominance by US tech (Google, xAI, Meta, Anthropic) is anticipated, with limited chances for Chinese models to overtake in the near term.</li>
<li>Legal and antitrust front: Heightened scrutiny on big tech (Apple, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet) reminiscent of Live Nation’s current monopoly scrutiny, increases headline risk for megacaps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Semiconductors:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Explosive growth in US semiconductor production in 2025, tied to demand from AI, autos, and reshored supply chains. Benefit for foundry, design, and semi-cap names.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Insurance and financial services are particularly exposed to data breach risks; expect increased compliance, regulation, and M&amp;A activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>c. Financials</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Banking:</strong>
<ul>
<li>JPMorgan leadership succession watch; possible longer-term shift in risk profile depending on CEO outcome.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong>
<ul>
<li>New S&amp;P 500 corporates are poised to add bitcoin to their balance sheets, continuing the theme of integration between traditional finance and crypto.</li>
<li>Bitcoin and Ethereum price stability at elevated historical levels; likely to stay a speculative but increasingly normalized asset for institutional allocators.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>d. Healthcare / Biotech</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approvals &amp; Drug Policy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The path to innovative cures (e.g., for Type 1 diabetes) remains slow; limited impact anticipated from headline biotech breakthroughs in the near-term, though gene-editing and new injectable preventatives (HIV, malaria) suggest growing focus on regulatory and reimbursement frameworks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Antitrust:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Momentum to curb pharmaceutical monopolies remains low through 2027, reducing risk of sudden legislative disruption to sector incumbents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>e. Media &amp; Entertainment</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Disney and Apple remain in the media spotlight (Marvel, Apple TV+), but with limited near-term impact on core equity fundamentals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Antitrust/Competition:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing scrutiny on streaming and ticketing (e.g., Live Nation) clouds long-duration media complex margins and M&amp;A possibilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>3. Individual Names/Events</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Very strong probability of holding world’s largest market cap status through year-end, reflecting dominance in AI/semis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tesla:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Deliveries growth is likely to remain subdued relative to most optimistic expectations; low likelihood of $30,000 Model Y or runaway unit growth.</li>
<li>Potential for FTC/antitrust inquiry is increasing, as is leadership risk (Elon Musk’s role, robotics initiatives).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Meta, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet:</strong>
<ul>
<li>All face ongoing or looming antitrust and monopoly litigation risk through year-end; possible headline-driven volatility spikes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>JPMorgan:</strong>
<ul>
<li>CEO succession will have wider financial sector implications, with leading successors impacting risk appetite and strategy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI and AI litigation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing risk of sizable legal settlements; likely pressure on AI business models and profit structures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Live Nation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Monopoly designation on the horizon, possibly forcing structural changes across ticketing and live event sector.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Watch List: Elevated Event Risk Over Coming Weeks</h2>
<ul>
<li>US-EU trade deal negotiation breakdowns or large-scale tariff implementations.</li>
<li>Fresh data on US payrolls/labor market and inflation; sequential impacts to consumer and B2B segments.</li>
<li>Japanese political leadership change and related FX/sovereign debt moves.</li>
<li>Major cyberattacks or regulatory actions in fintech/insurance sectors.</li>
<li>AI and big tech antitrust litigations or surprise regulatory pushes.</li>
<li>Geopolitical flare-ups in Asia (Japan, Taiwan, Thailand/Cambodia) and Eurozone membership tensions.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Second-order focus:</strong><br />
Industrials with US-based manufacturing, US domestic energy/resource producers, alternative stores of value (e.g., gold, crypto), and long/short plays tied to regulatory risks in healthcare and big tech. Remain vigilant for sudden surges in rates volatility or risk-off, especially as labor market cools and political volatility ramps up into the US election year.</p>
