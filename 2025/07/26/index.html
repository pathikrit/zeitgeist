<hr />
<h2>1. Macro &amp; Policy</h2>
<h3>Federal Reserve &amp; US Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fed is expected to hold rates steady, with moderate probability of one or two cuts in 2025 but little chance of hikes or emergency cuts. Three cuts or more look unlikely.</li>
<li>Market sees inflation as likely to remain above the 3% level, with some chance of it rising further, but no extreme inflation tail risk.</li>
<li>Recession risk for 2025 remains modest, but not absent. Default risk on US debt remains negligible despite sustained congressional drama. US national debt is on track to continue climbing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Steepening yield curves and stickier inflation expectations keep long-term real yields elevated, favoring spread products and inflation-protected securities.</li>
<li>Limited upside for duration-heavy fixed income. Maintain hedges against upside inflation scenarios (TIPS, commodities, gold).</li>
<li>Macro environment continues to favor risk assets over treasuries on pullbacks, but keep powder dry for volatility spikes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal &amp; Domestic Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>US debt is set to pass $38T, confirming structurally high fiscal deficits—likely to keep real rates and inflation expectations buoyant.</li>
<li>Immigration crackdowns and new contracts for detention signal ongoing pressure on labor markets and certain consumer sectors.</li>
<li>Political volatility in Texas/California redistricting may not immediately change investment theses but increases longer-term domestic policy and regulatory risks.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2. Geopolitics &amp; Sector Impact</h2>
<h3>Middle East &amp; Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li>France's recognition of Palestine signals potential for broader European realignment but does not alter the short-term strategic standoff. Israel-Gaza hostilities are entrenched, and ceasefire prospects remain muted.</li>
<li>Oil and gas remain sensitive to further deterioration in regional security (Gaza, Iran, Israel-Syria dynamics).</li>
<li>Thailand-Cambodia border fighting underscores ongoing risks in EM Asia and potential knock-on effects for global supply chains.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Defense &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li>No sign of quick Russia-Ukraine ceasefire; entrenched conflict supports elevated defense sector demand, European energy risk premium, and potential for upside in certain grains and metals due to Black Sea uncertainties.</li>
<li>Leadership transitions in Russia and Israel are unlikely in the near term.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Systemic Risk</h3>
<ul>
<li>Crypto market structure appears robust—Tether disruption or systemic de-peg not seen as likely this year.</li>
<li>Regulatory momentum for Ripple and Dogecoin ETFs signals continued mainstreaming of risk-on crypto exposure.</li>
<li>Bitcoin expected to remain above recent cycle lows, with meaningful upside potential driven by ETF flows and institutional adoption.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>3. Sector &amp; Thematic</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; Semiconductors</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nvidia favored to remain the world’s largest company by market cap through year-end, reflecting deep investor conviction in generative AI leadership.</li>
<li>Apple and Microsoft remain core ecosystem players, but are unlikely to regain the top market cap tier in the short run.</li>
<li>No major management risk events anticipated at tech giants (Apple, Google, Amazon).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Biotech</h3>
<ul>
<li>EU approval of transformative HIV therapies suggests further innovation and M&amp;A at the intersection of biotech and big pharma. Monitor for potential US approval readthroughs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Housing &amp; Consumer</h3>
<ul>
<li>US housing market is tight, with sales volume dampened but prices at a record high. Little relief expected for would-be buyers as low supply persists; construction and home improvement activity likely sustained.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cannabis &amp; Regulation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cannabis rescheduling in the US is unlikely to occur in the next six months, muting immediate sector upside.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>4. Key Individual Names</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia</strong>: Further upside potential; AI hardware supply remains tight, and no evidence of a demand cliff.</li>
<li><strong>Paramount</strong>: Completion of Skydance merger adds scale but raises integration risk.</li>
<li><strong>Apple, Microsoft, Google</strong>: Stable management outlook, minimal leadership risk.</li>
<li><strong>MicroStrategy</strong>: No plans to sell Bitcoin, cementing its role as the highest-beta listed play on crypto prices.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Summary Tactical View</h2>
<ul>
<li>Growth, tech, and AI leadership remain intact. Stay overweight semis and core US tech, especially Nvidia.</li>
<li>US treasury and IG bonds face duration risk as real yields remain sticky; TIPS and gold for inflation insurance.</li>
<li>Maintain some EM and global commodities exposure on geopolitical volatility.</li>
<li>Crypto has tailwinds, but systemic disruption risk remains extremely low.</li>
<li>Homebuilders and residential services continue to benefit from persistent US housing supply shortages.</li>
<li>Defense and aerospace remain a constructive backdrop on global security instability.</li>
</ul>
