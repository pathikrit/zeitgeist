</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Policy Backdrop</h2>
<h3>US Economy and Market Tone</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soft Landing Persists:</strong> Broad consensus expects a continued ‘soft landing’ macro backdrop—low recession risk short term, with positive earnings growth and mild unemployment increases. Recession risk through year-end foregrounded but not acute.
<ul>
<li>S&amp;P 500 highly likely to remain positive for the year, though further steep price appreciation looks less probable from here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market:</strong> Unemployment expected to edge a bit higher in coming months but dramatic job losses are not imminent. Tech sector layoffs are expected to be steeper y/y, albeit likely offset by other sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation &amp; Rates:</strong> Both core and headline inflation are likely to remain above pre-pandemic levels but moderate compared to 2022-24 peaks. Wage growth is expected to outpace inflation, supporting consumer spending but putting a floor under CPI.
<ul>
<li>Energy and commodity price volatility may drive short-term CPI spikes, especially if broad-based tariffs are enacted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>US Debt &amp; Fiscal Policy:</strong> National debt continues its sharp march upwards; debt ceiling will be raised. Expects renewed focus on long-term fiscal imbalances (debt-to-GDP likely &gt; 120% in the next cycle); this adds upward bias to yields, especially on the long end.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trade, Tariffs &amp; Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Tariff Regime Imminent:</strong> Major new US tariffs on a wide set of trading partners (China, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, EU, etc.) are highly likely in 2025, including on critical supply chain inputs (copper, possibly semiconductors, and even Canadian goods).
<ul>
<li>Immediate impacts: Cost-push inflation, upward pressure on finished goods and autos, supply chain disruptions, retaliatory trade actions likely from Asia and the EU.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Middle East &amp; EU Instability:</strong> Renewed conflict in Gaza, France’s recognition of Palestine increase headline risk for energy prices and defense-related equities, but risk of direct global market spillover is limited for now.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil &amp; Gas Outlook:</strong> Oil prices likely to remain in a lower range barring large supply shocks, even as OPEC cut risk lingers. US natural gas expected higher y/y, supporting earnings for gas-exposed producers, while coal remains a default global baseload despite policy rhetoric.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Mix:</strong> No immediate regime shift to renewables—coal remains (unfortunately for carbon risk) the largest global source through 2030.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; Semiconductors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chips:</strong> US semiconductor output surging in 2025, but new tariffs on Asian chip supply chains could undermine the pace of margin expansion and disrupt tech firms with complex global sourcing.</li>
<li><strong>Tech Layoffs:</strong> Big tech continuing to rightsize workforces; expect margin efficiency focus and potential near-term operating leverage.</li>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong> Microsoft and other cloud providers face rising risk and cost of cyber breaches—potential negative second-order impact on sector trust and EOQ sales pipelines.</li>
<li><strong>Big Tech Antitrust:</strong> Antitrust risk is materializing for Amazon, Apple, and Live Nation. Over a multi-year horizon, expect headline-driven volatility and incremental regulatory headwinds for dominant platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Leadership Shifts:</strong> NVIDIA likely to retain its position as world’s largest company by market cap into year-end; further CEO transitions (JPMorgan, Google, Amazon, OpenAI) are low-probability tail events for 2025.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy, Utilities, Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Utilities and Clean Tech:</strong> US solar buildout continues at pace, but headline-driven volatility can be expected—tariffs or commodity price shifts could create buying opportunities on weakness.</li>
<li><strong>Commodities:</strong> Copper and other industrial metals face new supply risks via tariffs, supporting prices but also increasing input costs for downstream US manufacturing and renewables; hedge cost structure in exposed sectors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials &amp; Real Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Financial Sector:</strong> Bank sector leadership (JPMorgan) transition likely in near future, but systemic risk is muted. Watch for US market circuit breaker events as a tail risk (not base case).</li>
<li><strong>Property, REITs, Insurance:</strong> No new evidence of forced shocks, but earthquake risk in California and Japan is non-trivial over the longer horizon. Margin headwinds for property &amp; casualty insurers with tail risk events possible; REITs remain interest-rate sensitive in rising Treasury yield context.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Pharma</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pharma Tariffs Watch:</strong> While less imminent than in tech or autos, watch for health sector tariff action—it would be inflationary for drug/biotech supply chains but not yet central scenario.</li>
<li><strong>Drug Approvals:</strong> EU advances in HIV drug technology could spill over to US, supporting sectoral outperformance for leading developers (Gilead, others).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Asset Class &amp; Strategy Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Equities:</strong> Remain overweight US broad indices with a tilt toward quality and margin-levered growth; expect only moderate further price upside near term, but positive earnings momentum should persist.</li>
<li><strong>Bonds:</strong> Upward pressure on yields through year-end due to fiscal slippage and tariff-driven inflation; long duration and TIPS fair for tactical hedging, but limited appreciation likely.</li>
<li><strong>Commodities:</strong> Remain cautious on oil upside unless fresh global supply disruption emerges. Copper and other critical inputs (rare earths, lithium) supported by trade policy but likely volatile.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong> Strong odds for continued upward momentum in Bitcoin and Ethereum, supported by ETF flows and macro uncertainty. Watch for sudden volatility amid broader market stress; base case for new highs by year-end.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company-Specific Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia expected to maintain global leadership by market cap; semis broadly supported by strong US production but supply chains exposed to tariffs.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Apple and Amazon both face increasing antitrust and regulatory scrutiny; expect episodic volatility but sector weight remains dominant.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gilead positioned for upside in HIV prevention market after EU approval.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Microsoft vulnerable to ongoing cyber risk headlines; monitor for sector-wide repercussions or guidance revision.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Live Nation faces high antitrust risk; monitor for potential forced divestiture or margin compression.</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Risks to Watch</h3>
<ul>
<li>Acceleration of US/China/EU trade wars beyond priced-in scenarios—watch for escalation signals or sectoral retaliation.</li>
<li>Outlier macro shocks: Geopolitical surprise (Middle East, Asia), major natural disaster, or a new pandemic, while low-probability, could change cross-asset relationships rapidly.</li>
<li>Systemic financial risk remains a tail risk, not the base case.</li>
</ul>
