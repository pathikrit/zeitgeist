</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macroeconomic Outlook</h2>
<h3>Growth, Inflation, and Fed Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US GDP growth is poised for modest expansion through 2025:</strong> Sub-2.5% growth is most likely, with recession risk present but not dominant for 2025–2026. Some slowdowns possible by Q3, with higher unemployment expected (above 4%).</li>
<li><strong>Inflation is likely to remain stubbornly above 2%, with a substantial risk of exceeding 3% in 2025.</strong> Short-term CPI momentum in August should confirm this “sticky” inflation regime (core and headline), with higher wage growth relative to inflation expected this year.</li>
<li><strong>No urgent Fed rate moves anticipated:</strong> Rates are likely to remain unchanged through July; dissent within the FOMC is likely, but the bar for an emergency move is high. A slow grind toward a lower rate environment (cut or two in 2025) is more probable than a sudden reversal.</li>
<li><strong>US National Debt is expected to surpass $38T within the year, and the debt ceiling is set to be raised, not abolished.</strong> Markets may grow more sensitive to Treasury issuance and deficit debates.</li>
<li><strong>Trump policy risk:</strong> Trade and fiscal policy hint at major tariffs across both Asia and Europe (esp. on copper, semiconductors, general goods)—likely to increase input costs, disrupt supply chains, and provoke countermeasures. Large tariffs are virtually certain for 2025, accentuating stagflationary risk if economic growth flags.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Currency &amp; Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>USD faces growing de-dollarization signals:</strong> The dollar index could post new cycle lows, increasing FX volatility, especially against EM currencies (notably MXN and BRL).</li>
<li><strong>Yield curve likely to flatten as Treasury yields remain pressured by debt supply concerns, sticky inflation, and hesitance on rate cuts.</strong> 5%+ Treasury yields still look unlikely this year, but the longer-term risk profile for US government bonds remains tilted toward higher volatility and greater correlation to inflation shocks.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Themes &amp; Asset Classes</h2>
<h3>Equities &amp; Credit</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>S&amp;P 500 outlook: High chance of a positive finish in 2025.</strong> However, a noticeable pullback to 5,300 or below by year-end is likely, with only modest odds of reaching extreme highs (6,700+) or deep sell-offs.</li>
<li><strong>Credit/fixed income:</strong> Persistent inflation plus larger deficits mean inflation-protected exposure and a cautious approach to long-dated Treasuries are warranted. Rates-sensitive sectors (REITs, utilities) are likely to underperform.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commodities &amp; Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global energy mix remains fossil fuel-dominated through 2030 (oil, coal, gas).</strong> Recent price action in oil (WTI) skews toward weaker prices by year-end, despite intermittent upside risks from OPEC, the SPR, and geopolitics.
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil prices likely rangebound or lower (WTI trading well below $75).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Natural gas is expected to remain elevated above $3 and spike above $4.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Copper and semiconductor tariffs loom, with potential supply disruptions or cost-push inflation in these sectors.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Solar and renewables are growing, but not fast enough near-term to disrupt hydrocarbons’ market leadership or commodity pricing.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crypto markets likely benefit from legislative movement:</strong> The odds favor new market structure laws passing this year, boosting institutional confidence, though tax and capital gains relief are not expected imminently.</li>
<li><strong>Leading stablecoins (USDC, USDT) face moderate regulatory paths and volatility risk.</strong> Depegging events remain unlikely, but ongoing scrutiny could shift capital, especially if broader de-dollarization themes accelerate.</li>
<li><strong>Bitcoin and Ethereum remain poised for positive returns, with significant room for growth—but expectations should be tempered versus extreme bull scenarios.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Biotech</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional drug approvals remain robust:</strong> Watch select FDA approvals (Elinzanetant, Donidalorsen, Sebetralstat) for sector trading opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Breakthroughs (e.g., Type 1 diabetes cures, psychedelic approvals) are unlikely in the next 3–5 years, muting expectations for sudden large-cap biotech outperformance.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>AI, Tech &amp; Media</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>New AI model launches (GPT-5, etc.) are imminent, driving persistent investment in semiconductors and large-scale tech.</strong> Sizable upside remains for AI infrastructure, but media/content disruption from full AI creation is still several years out.</li>
<li><strong>Tech leadership risk remains moderate</strong> (e.g., exec transitions at Google, OpenAI), but does not suggest immediate sector shakeups.</li>
<li>*<em>Litigation over AI content (OpenAI/NYT) could result in meaningful damages and more onerous IP/licensing obligations, affecting AI platforms’ profitability.</em></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitics &amp; Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>US-China and US-EU trade friction: Expect tariffs and reciprocal measures, particularly on tech (semiconductors), autos, and commodities.</strong> Accelerated de-globalization and higher supply chain risk premiums could become persistent themes.</li>
<li><strong>Global hot spots:</strong> Middle East instability (Gaza famine, Israel-Hamas conflict, France/Europe policy shifts), Russia-Ukraine offensive, and Asian flashpoints (Thailand-Cambodia, Taiwan political moves) all raise tail risk for commodity prices and global equities.</li>
<li><strong>Domestic political wildcards:</strong> Looming government shutdown risk, further Congressional gridlock, and unpredictable shifts in administration personnel could add volatility to rates and equities.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Names to Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tesla:</strong> Short-term EV production/delivery targets on track; moderate but not transformational upside from robotaxi or major new launches within year likely. Low odds of major CEO (Musk) change, but supply chain costs could be impacted by tariffs.</li>
<li><strong>JPMorgan:</strong> CEO transition risk remains on the horizon but not immediate.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Possible legal damages and ongoing organizational reshuffling; Sam Altman’s stake and role remain under scrutiny.</li>
<li><strong>Boeing:</strong> Some CEO turnover risk, but not certain; sector continues to face operational and reputational headwinds.</li>
<li><strong>Pharma/Biotech:</strong> Monitor FDA calendar for selective approval/denial events; no blockbuster pipeline shockers on horizon.</li>
<li><strong>Apple/Samsung/Google:</strong> Strong hardware cycle (Foldables, Pixel 10 etc.), but limited near-term regulatory or litigation risk.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Tactical Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintain equity exposure, but prepare for pronounced volatility and sector rotation as tariffs, inflation, and political noise dominate.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Prefer shorter-duration or inflation-protected bonds.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stay nimble on energy, crypto, and semiconductor themes—these are all subject to sharp policy-, supply-, and demand-driven moves.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Monitor ongoing AI, media, healthcare, and consumer tech litigation and regulatory actions for second-order impacts.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stay alert to EM FX and commodity tail risk from escalating geopolitical and climate events.</strong></li>
</ul>
