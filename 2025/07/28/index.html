<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Global Economic Outlook</h2>
<h3>US Macroeconomy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growth and Inflation:</strong> Market consensus expects modest US GDP growth through year-end, with low probability of recession in 2025. Most bets foresee a &quot;soft landing,&quot; avoiding both recession and out-of-control inflation. Still, core and headline inflation are likely to remain above the 3% mark, keeping real yields subdued but not deeply negative.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market:</strong> Unemployment is expected to drift higher but remain manageable. Job creation appears to be steady; no major surprises anticipated.</li>
<li><strong>Rate Policy:</strong> The Federal Reserve is expected to hold steady through 2025, with only a mild chance of a significant rate cut and minimal odds of a hike. Treasury yields could dip below 4% but are unlikely to collapse to earlier cycle lows. Inflation-linked bonds (TIPS) may offer protection against persistent 3-4% inflation, but upside seems capped barring a stagflation shock.</li>
</ul>
<h3>US Debt &amp; Fiscal Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Federal Debt:</strong> US debt will remain at elevated levels, comfortably surpassing $38 trillion. Fiscal deficits are expected to widen, given likely government spending increases and ambitious infrastructure/defense outlays.</li>
<li><strong>Shutdown Risk:</strong> There is a meaningful risk of a government shutdown this year, introducing potential volatility in both risk assets and Treasuries.</li>
<li><strong>Debt Ceiling:</strong> No acute risk of default; the ceiling is expected to be raised as needed, but continued fiscal caution is warranted.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Trade &amp; Tariffs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tariffs:</strong> With new US leadership, tariffs are set to intensify broadly, targeting major economies (including the EU, China, Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Canada) and sectors like autos, semiconductors, and commodities (notably copper).</li>
<li><strong>Trade Deals:</strong> While new trade agreement headlines are supportive of risk assets, true barriers remain for deals with most major economies outside the EU. Expect volatility as negotiations play out, particularly in manufacturing, autos, and supply chain-exposed sectors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>FX and Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>De-dollarization:</strong> The USD faces cyclical pressure and is poised to test lower levels this year. EM currencies like the Mexican peso remain fragile, with Latin American FX broadly under pressure.</li>
<li><strong>EUR/USD Outlook:</strong> Both upside and volatility potential—increased EU-US trade integration is euro-supportive; large swings possible.</li>
<li><strong>Commodities:</strong> Oil prices face two-way risk—potential for mid-year retracement to lower levels but spikes above $80 not ruled out. Natural gas expected to remain firm. Copper and supply-chain-related commodities might see turbulence from tariffs.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; Semiconductors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI / Semiconductors:</strong> The US semiconductor sector is expected to post robust production growth, boosted by EV/computing demand and onshoring incentives. NVDA likely to remain market cap leader; supply chain scrutiny increasing, especially over US-China tensions and new tariffs. Samsung's deal with Tesla highlights growing non-Chinese alliances.</li>
<li><strong>Big Tech Regulation:</strong> Antitrust action is a live issue for Amazon and Apple; both face moderate-to-high legal/regulatory risks over the next few years.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Renewables</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transition &amp; Mix:</strong> Coal and oil remain dominant energy sources into 2030, despite expectations of significant EV market share by then (above 30%, possibly above 50%). Renewables and nuclear will continue gaining, but not fast enough to displace hydrocarbons in the core mix by decade-end.</li>
<li><strong>Utilities &amp; Climate Targets:</strong> US and EU climate goals are at risk of shortfall; India is comparatively better positioned to meet targets. Carbon emissions are very likely to keep rising in the medium term, supporting energy and utilities complexity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Autos &amp; EV</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>EV Momentum:</strong> EV adoption is on track to exceed 30% global market share by 2030, but few expect Tesla to launch a mass-market sub-$30k EV soon. US-EU and US-China auto tariffs may disrupt 2025-2026 production and pricing, potentially creating volatility in legacy and EV names alike.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla:</strong> Steady delivery/prod numbers expected, upside from Samsung chip partnership, but no near-term affordable model or hybrid announcement likely.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Biotech</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Innovation:</strong> New diabetes treatments (including a &quot;cure&quot;) are unlikely to materialize before 2033, but GLP-1 drug price erosion is probable; watch for price pressure on Ozempic and insulin.</li>
<li><strong>Psychedelics:</strong> Moderate chance of FDA approval for some medical use within 2 years, adding option value to specialized biotech names.</li>
<li><strong>FDA Approvals:</strong> Several key drugs with approvals expected soon, keeping biotech sector in the spotlight.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>JPMorgan:</strong> Leadership succession focus remains; investors monitoring for any sudden CEO transition news.</li>
<li><strong>Debt and Rates:</strong> Treasury volatility remains an ongoing theme—uncertainty on yield levels (possibility for both sub-4% and near-5% in the next 12 months).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Estate</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Coasts:</strong> Rents in NYC and SF remain firm with meaningful increases expected; REIT exposure here remains relatively resilient. Insurance REITs and catastrophe risk come into focus given persistent megaquake and natural disaster event risks for California.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consumer Discretionary &amp; Entertainment</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sports/media events, box office, music releases</strong> all point to strong consumer engagement. Video game spending, streaming, and music platforms remain beneficiaries of ongoing demand.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Thematic/Geopolitical Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geopolitics:</strong> Ukraine conflict remains a wild card for defense and energy. Regional risks (SE Asia, Middle East) are ever-present but not driving the base case for risk assets at the moment.</li>
<li><strong>Natural Disaster Risk:</strong> Slightly elevated risk premiums may persist for West Coast insurance, real estate, and utilities from megaquake talk and elevated seismic activity headlines.</li>
<li><strong>China Tech:</strong> Tech decoupling continues; Chinese firms are bolstering internal alliances, hinting at continued divergence from US tech stack.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Names to Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia (NVDA):</strong> Likely to maintain or expand global leadership in market cap; AI/sovereign, data center, gaming, and automotive verticals in focus for next earnings.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla (TSLA):</strong> Steady delivery outlook, supply boost from Samsung chips, but little near-term product lineup disruption. Scrap sub-$30k Model Y thesis for now.</li>
<li><strong>Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN):</strong> Both face significant ongoing antitrust risk, though not existential over the next year. Limited expectation of major new product lines emerging this year.</li>
<li><strong>JPMorgan (JPM):</strong> Succession planning in headlines, but no imminent leadership shake-up expected.</li>
<li><strong>Spotify (SPOT):</strong> Stream, music, and content growth likely to continue amid multiple major artist releases and competitive positioning.</li>
<li><strong>Novo Nordisk (NVO):</strong> Watch out for further price pressure on Ozempic.</li>
<li><strong>Defense/Utilities/Insurance names:</strong> Second-order risks around EU/US energy transition, European security, and California quake risk bring exposure opportunities and potential hazards.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Actionables &amp; Watchpoints</h2>
<ul>
<li>Maintain balanced risk exposure: persistent inflation (3-4%), slow but positive growth, and elevated geopolitical/trade volatility all point to the need for both cyclical upside and defensives.</li>
<li>Watch for further tariff &amp; trade news: spike in protectionism could quickly rotate sector winners/losers (autos, semis, manufacturing, consumer goods).</li>
<li>Track Fed/Treasury signals: treasuries may rally on falling yields but remain vulnerable to fiscal/deficit scares.</li>
<li>Seek optionality in select risk events: FDA/biotech approvals, antitrust headlines, catastrophic risk, and regulatory changes in crypto/tech.</li>
</ul>
