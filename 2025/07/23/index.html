<h1>Daily Memo (23-Jul-2025)</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Top News Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Middle East/Humanitarian:</strong> Gaza humanitarian crisis deepens as widespread starvation is reported, increasing geopolitical risk and ongoing pressure on energy and defense sectors.</li>
<li><strong>US/Asia Trade:</strong> US announces trade agreements with the Philippines, Indonesia, and Japan; Philippines goods face significant new tariffs.</li>
<li><strong>Tariffs &amp; Auto Earnings:</strong> GM discloses a $1.1B hit from tariffs, signifying immediate corporate profit headwinds from current US trade policy.</li>
<li><strong>US Politics/Regulation:</strong> DOJ fires newly appointed US attorney in NJ, reflecting volatile and changing regulatory environment.</li>
<li><strong>Digital Finance:</strong> Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon collaborate to digitize $7 trillion in money markets, potentially reshaping institutional liquidity and fintech.</li>
<li><strong>Climate &amp; Courts:</strong> World Court prepares for landmark ruling on climate litigation—potential legal ripple effects for fossil fuels, insurers, and heavy industry.</li>
<li><strong>UN/US Withdrawal:</strong> US withdraws from UNESCO over social/cultural issues, highlighting continued US isolationism and potential soft power friction.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Currency Outlook</h2>
<h3>US Fiscal, Inflation, and Economic Growth</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debt &amp; Deficit:</strong> US national debt will rise above $38T by year-end with a strong likelihood to top $40T under a second Trump term. Large and persistent deficits point to sustained heavy Treasury issuance, supporting an environment of elevated long-term yields and likely curve steepening.
<ul>
<li><strong>Second-order effect:</strong> Higher debt and fiscal uncertainty may encourage rotation into TIPS, gold, and defensive asset classes given possible higher risk premiums.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tariff Regime:</strong> Very high likelihood of significant new tariffs—including on copper and Brazilian goods—in 2025. Expect immediate inflationary pressure on affected imported goods, retaliatory measures, potential earnings headwinds (auto, industrials, semiconductors), and supply chain rebalancing.
<ul>
<li><strong>Currency nuance:</strong> Tariffs risk weakening EM currencies heavily tied to US supply chains (notably MXN, BRL).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Inflation &amp; Rates:</strong> Neither runaway inflation nor sub-2% CPI anticipated; 2025 consensus sees inflation mostly in the 2.6%–4% range. The Fed is expected to cut rates modestly (probably 1–2 times), but an aggressive pivot remains unlikely absent a strong downturn.
<ul>
<li><strong>Labor:</strong> Unemployment is rising above 4%, and payroll growth is stalling, revealing cooling jobs momentum—yet not overt recession levels.</li>
<li><strong>Recession odds:</strong> Market pricing implies roughly 1-in-5 chance of US recession for 2025, suggesting that most risk assets are not positioned for a large growth shock.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>USD Direction:</strong> The dollar is showing weakness, with a meaningful chance of the DXY under 95 this year. This could boost EM value, US exporters, and commodities in USD terms, while lifting US import prices modestly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics, Defense &amp; Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Middle East:</strong> Ongoing conflict and regime uncertainty in Iran, plus Gaza crisis, maintain a premium for defense contractors and present persistent supply risk in energy markets, albeit oil is currently trending lower.</li>
<li><strong>EU/UK:</strong> New trade alignments (UK-Turkey, US-Japan/Philippines/Indonesia) and continuing realignment in Europe warrant monitoring for implications on defense, energy, and industrial supply chains.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Asset-Class Insights</h2>
<h3>Trade, Manufacturing, Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Autos/Industrial:</strong> Near-certain aggressive tariffs will continue to weigh on US automakers (as seen with GM’s $1.1B hit) and global supply chains. Expect manufacturers with North America supply redundancy to gain an edge; sourcing strategies and capital expenditure will accelerate “re-shoring” and automation investments.
<ul>
<li><strong>Copper, Commodities:</strong> Copper faces high risk of targeted tariffs, setting up price volatility and margin crush for US-based copper users while offering relative benefit to North American suppliers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Energy:</strong> Natural gas is expected to sharply rebound in price; oil is seeing both downside and upside volatility—global oversupply and political disruptions could coexist.
<ul>
<li><strong>Solar/Green:</strong> Accelerating US solar installs remain probable, but the sector will miss very ambitious upper-end targets. Policy support continues, but component tariffs may squeeze margins and slow deployment rates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Financials/Tokenization:</strong> The move by Goldman and BNY to digitize large swathes of the money market is early evidence of where institutional fintech is going. Expect disruptions in asset management and traditional custody; near-term winners may be tech-enabled financial services over legacy providers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tech, Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Big Tech:</strong> Microsoft unlikely to become world’s largest by year-end, with Alphabet, Apple, and Tesla even less likely in the next 6 months. Management changes at Amazon, Google, Twitch are not expected in the near term, keeping company/sector leadership stable.</li>
<li><strong>AI/Software:</strong> OpenAI’s forthcoming GPT-5 release and Microsoft’s Surface/Windows updates drive defensible AI and device spending narratives, but do not radically reconfigure sector leadership yet.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong> Bitcoin and Ethereum remain on upward trajectory, with large probability of breaking all-time highs but little chance of absolute extremes ($1M BTC). Some volatility and correction risk, but not outsized compared to tech stocks.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company-Specific &amp; Thematic Notes</h2>
<h3>Tesla ($TSLA)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Next earnings call to emphasize autonomy (robotaxi, FSD, Optimus), supply chain tariffs, and regulatory navigation. Large Q3 deliveries (&gt;350k) are highly probable, giving operational strength but continued headline risk around trade policy.
<ul>
<li><strong>Second-order:</strong> Major autopilot/AI themes could reinforce investor narrative of Tesla as a tech, not car, company—potentially supporting premium valuations even in cyclical slumps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Gaming &amp; Media</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Take-Two (TTWO):</strong> GTA6 on-time release remains likely, which could catalyze sizable earnings upside for the gaming sector.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Market Technicals &amp; Systemic Risk</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Equities:</strong> Probable gains in both S&amp;P and Nasdaq through year-end—no systemic crash expected, but risks around government shutdown and circuit breaker triggers remain non-trivial. US macro softness limits upside, but tech sector and AI themes likely buoy indices.</li>
<li><strong>Government Operations:</strong> Heightened government shutdown risk (near-even odds before 2026) injects fiscal policy unpredictability—be cautious of Treasurys, and government-dependent sectors.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Second &amp; Third-Order Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>EM Exposure:</strong> Tariff-driven EM currency and equity selloff risk is real; yet dollar weakness could attract capital back to selective emerging markets, especially whose exports circumvent direct US tariffs.</li>
<li><strong>Supply Chain/Industrial Policy:</strong> Companies heavily reliant on supply chains through Mexico, Brazil, or China may need urgent due diligence—winners will be those with proximity to US/Canada.</li>
<li><strong>Digital Asset Security:</strong> Tether de-pegging and stablecoin concerns persist in the background—perceived but not immediate systemic risk.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In the short-to-intermediate term, expect markets to price in: (a) a hawkishly protectionist shift in US trade policy, (b) persistent but manageable inflation, (c) strong AI/tech and selective commodity outperformance, (d) non-trivial, but not systemic, geopolitical and market risk. Key actions involve sector rotation towards US-focused industrials, defense, AI/tech, and selective energy/commodities, while managing downside via inflation-linked assets, careful EM allocation, and monitoring for spikes in volatility prompted by fiscal or monetary surprises.</p>
