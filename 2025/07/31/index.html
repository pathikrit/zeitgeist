<li>No signals of major federal spending cuts in the near term.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Geopolitics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Arab states and Canada moving toward recognizing a Palestinian state; UK and France expected to follow; conditional on two-state solution talks.</li>
<li>Arab League and Israel dialogue intensifies as pressure mounts for Hamas to disarm; stability in the region is tentative.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Corporate/Earnings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft surges on Azure and AI-driven revenue, reaching $4T market cap.</li>
<li>Meta stock jumps 12% post-earnings: AI fueling social platform engagement as talent and infrastructure investments escalate.</li>
<li>Apple appears likely to hike iPhone 17 prices but not launching a foldable device in 2025; posts positive Q4 outlook.</li>
<li>Mixed tech sector signals: Meta and Microsoft momentum, but no confirmation of market leadership shifts among &quot;Magnificent 7&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sectoral Themes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hurricanes: Most likely scenario for 2025 is a moderately active Atlantic season (16–19 named storms), potentially impacting insurance, construction, and Gulf Coast energy logistics.</li>
<li>AI: Anthropic emerges as plausible breakout for top model leadership, ahead of Meta/OpenAI/Nvidia. Rapid talent and capex competition among major providers.</li>
<li>Crypto: Elevated talk of Tether/USDT risk but actual insolvency or depeg in 2025 remains a tail event. Ethereum strength persists.</li>
<li>Cannabis: US rescheduling or regulatory relaxation in 2025 moderately possible; investor optimism in related healthcare and consumer spaces warranted but not urgent.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro and Policy</h2>
<h3>Fiscal &amp; Monetary Landscape</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spending &amp; Deficit</strong>: Federal spending cuts of any meaningful scale appear extremely unlikely in the coming quarters. Fiscal tailwinds continue supporting equities and risk assets; deficit will remain elevated and government stimulus persistent in the FY25 outlook.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rates</strong>: Fed is currently on hold, with base case anticipating up to two cuts in 2025, but a non-trivial (~1 in 4) chance of no cuts as long as strong GDP and labor data persist. Emergency cuts and stagflation are not central risks.</li>
<li><strong>Trade/Tariffs</strong>: Sudden 15% tariffs on Korean imports underscore policy unpredictability in trade, likely to drive cyclical volatility in auto, electronics, and industrial supply chains.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning Implications</strong>: Maintain exposure to risk-assets and sectors benefiting from fiscal support and policy continuity. Remain alert for volatility flashpoints linked to tariffs and new trade disputes, particularly for multinational manufacturers.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitical Risk</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Middle East</strong>: Growing Western and Arab momentum for a two-state solution places additional tail risk on regional stability, but immediate energy supply disruptions unlikely without kinetic escalation.</li>
<li><strong>Russia/Ukraine</strong>: Low odds of a near-term ceasefire, and even lower probability for leadership change in Russia. Ukraine NATO accession is very unlikely next year—status quo continues.</li>
<li><strong>East Asia</strong>: Limited risk of a China-Taiwan military clash in the very near term, but tensions justify defensive posturing in globally exposed manufacturing supply chains and EM-focused portfolios.</li>
<li><strong>Iran</strong>: While succession risk for Khamenei is non-trivial, outright upheaval is not imminent. Watch for incremental oil market reaction if rumors escalate.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors</h2>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI</strong>: Anthropic likely to take a major leadership position, with aggressive investment in AI capabilities mirrored by Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI. Cost of talent and innovation spend accelerating, helping drive earnings of cloud and semiconductor-related names.</li>
<li><strong>Big Tech Earnings</strong>: Microsoft and Meta demonstrating strong operational leverage from AI rollouts. Apple's price hike plans signal confidence in premium demand; no foldables, but further refresh cycles will support margins.</li>
<li><strong>Antitrust/Fragmentation</strong>: No short-term forced breakup for Meta, but continued regulatory pressure and M&amp;A scrutiny remain in background.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consumer &amp; Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cannabis/Healthcare Regulation</strong>: Moderate probability of cannabis regulatory rescheduling in 2025 supports optionality in US healthcare and consumer stocks exposed to the theme. Mainstream healthcare and pharmaceutical vaccine policy changes have low odds.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer Sentiment</strong>: Entertainment and consumer discretionary demand steady, with no box office or product “super-cycles” on immediate horizon.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy, Climate, Insurance</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hurricanes/Natural Cat Events</strong>: Consensus expects a moderately active hurricane season. Monitor for claims exposure in insurance and real-assets/infrastructure in Gulf states.</li>
<li><strong>Commodities/Oil</strong>: Geopolitical situation stable enough to limit oil/gas price shock in near-term, but monitor Iran, Middle East negotiations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stablecoins</strong>: Market openly fretting over USDT solvency and depeg, but actual tail risk is remote for 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Ethereum &amp; Altcoins</strong>: Outperformance of ETH versus legacy crypto is plausible near term; sector remains in “risk-on” mode, but event-driven dislocations still possible.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Names &amp; Corporate Themes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microsoft</strong>: Strong AI/cloud momentum, surpassing $4T cap. Current trajectory supports continued sector outperformance.</li>
<li><strong>Meta</strong>: Beat-and-raise quarter with AI engagement, offsetting regulatory overhang.</li>
<li><strong>Apple</strong>: Pricing power reflected in planned iPhone hikes; no competitive disruption from foldables for now.</li>
<li><strong>Waymo/Uber</strong>: While AV market evolution continues, Waymo overtaking Uber in San Francisco remains unlikely this year.</li>
<li><strong>Tether (USDT)</strong>: Scrutiny persists, and any sudden loss of peg could be a liquidity shock, but base case is continued resilience.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla</strong>: Leadership change not expected.</li>
<li><strong>Ethereum (ETH)</strong>: Strong relative momentum among digital assets.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Tactical Watchlist</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monitor for any abrupt macro or trade policy pivots; maintain defensive hedges in sectors directly exposed to tariffs.</li>
<li>Remain overweight AI/cloud tech majors on continued positive earnings revision cycle.</li>
<li>Maintain defensive positions in insurance and utility/rate-sensitive sectors given both hurricane risk and uncertain Fed cut cadence.</li>
<li>Be aware of sudden tail event risk in stablecoins and monitor for any catalysts in cannabis or healthcare re/regulation.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Overall Thesis</strong>:<br />
The macro environment remains constructive for US risk assets, with fiscal and monetary policy supportive and no major disinflation or fiscal retrenchment on the horizon. Geopolitical developments should be watched, but short-term global disruption odds are contained. Technology sector, led by AI and digital infrastructure, remains a structural outperformer, and US consumer demand is healthy, with select opportunities in regulatory themes and digital assets.</p>
