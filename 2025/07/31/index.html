<h1>Daily Memo (31-Jul-2025)</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Key News Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trump announces tariffs on multiple countries; South Korea secures a last-minute deal, but trade rows with Canada, India, China, EU intensify. Ford projects $2bn hit from tariffs.</strong></li>
<li><strong>S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq futures surge on strong Meta and Microsoft results. Tech sector momentum continues amid AI optimism.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fed holds rates steady for the fifth time; growing tension between the Fed and the White House.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Meta shares climb after strong AI-fueled earnings; Microsoft also beats expectations.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Russian airstrikes escalate against Ukraine; UK and EU express renewed focus on Gaza and Palestine issue, with Canada recognizing Palestinian state, which impacts US-EU-Israel dynamics.</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macroeconomic Overview</h2>
<h3>US Economy &amp; Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal outlook</strong>: US federal spending is set for substantial increases in 2025, with strong indications of at least $500bn in new expenditures and national debt edging past $38trn.</li>
<li><strong>Rate environment</strong>: The Fed is expected to keep policy rates steady through 2025; chances of rate hikes or emergency cuts remain remote. A moderate probability exists for one or two rate cuts, suggesting a cautiously neutral to slightly accommodative stance.</li>
<li><strong>Labor market</strong>: Unemployment risks are mounting for the medium term (several years), but near-term jobs data remains within growth territory. Tech sector layoffs are expected to accelerate versus 2024; broader labor market softness is implied but not immediately acute.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation</strong>: Both headline and core inflation are pressured, but sustained high inflation is not priced in; consensus expects a soft landing between 2.5–4% for 2025.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics and Trade</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protectionism intensifies</strong>: The US administration's aggressive use of tariffs is upending global supply chains, with measures against major economies (China, EU, Japan, South Korea, Canada, Taiwan, Mexico) and targeted sectors (semiconductors, copper, pharma). This is likely to elevate price volatility in affected industries and encourage onshoring.</li>
<li><strong>US disengagement from international bodies</strong>: While talk of withdrawal from organizations like the WTO or World Bank remains, immediate exits are not imminent but cannot be ignored as looming risks for global trade architecture.</li>
<li><strong>EM currency depreciation</strong>: The Mexican peso and Brazilian real face substantial devaluation risk, supporting a stronger USD against EM FX in the short term.</li>
</ul>
<h3>International Risks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Russia/Ukraine conflict</strong> continues; ceasefire prospects remain low. Consequent tail risks for European energy and commodity flows persist.</li>
<li><strong>No imminent risk of nuclear weapon use</strong> but geopolitical uncertainty remains a tail risk to global markets.</li>
<li><strong>Japan and Europe</strong>: Elevated risk of recession in Japan, UK, and Germany. India remains more resilient in climate and growth outlooks.</li>
<li><strong>Euro fragmentation</strong>: Low/remote probability of new EU referenda or EU member exits before 2030, but continued trade/political frictions could pressure the EUR over time.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Implications</h2>
<h3>Technology/AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Big Tech remains dominant</strong>: Meta, Microsoft, and Google continue to outperform on AI bets and operational results. Nvidia is strongly positioned to become the world’s largest public company, driven by AI demand.</li>
<li><strong>AI Regulation and Nationalization</strong>: There is a meaningful risk of policy intervention or regulation of leading AI companies/projects in the US before 2030; this could cap upside or introduce volatility for major AI players.</li>
<li><strong>Layoff wave in tech</strong>: Cost-cutting and automation could further soften wage and employment dynamics in tech hubs, impacting real estate (especially in SF/NYC) and discretionary consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Semiconductors</strong>: Strong production growth expected in 2025, but tariffs and supply chain friction pose both risk and opportunity for domestic chipmakers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil price trajectory</strong>: WTI oil likely to remain rangebound or pressured, with downside to the mid/high 60s and only moderate upside risk to $90 (supply shocks, geopolitical events).</li>
<li><strong>Copper and metals</strong>: Trade barriers and tariffs, especially on copper, could create supply disruptions and volatility in industrial metals.</li>
<li><strong>Renewable transition</strong>: US and EU climate targets remain challenging for 2030; India is more likely to meet its goals. Near-term power mix favors coal, oil, and gas over wind/solar, slowing transition investment themes.</li>
<li><strong>Nuclear sector</strong>: Early moves toward nuclear-powered data centers hint at future growth for the sector, albeit with a longer lead time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Biotech</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tariffs on pharma likely</strong>: These could raise input costs for US pharma and biotech, possibly affecting margins or triggering sector rotation.</li>
<li><strong>Biotech innovation</strong>: The outlook for breakthrough cures (like Type 1 diabetes) remains promising but is years away from fully investable certainty.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Estate</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Urban rents</strong>: Robust rent growth in NYC (well above 5%) and positive momentum in SF suggest urban multifamily/REITs may remain resilient despite tech employment volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Natural disasters</strong>: No immediate major tail risks (earthquakes, supervolcanoes); but insurance and reinsurance pricing in CA/Japan warrant attention for outsized, low-probability shocks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financial Markets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Equities</strong>: Base case sees the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq finishing the year positive, near or above recent highs. Limited downside risk dominates barring an exogenous shock.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed Income</strong>: Persistent high US debt and spending could pressure long-end Treasuries over time; limited expectation for aggressive rate cuts in 2025 tempers upside for bonds.</li>
<li><strong>Commodities/Crypto</strong>: Volatility persists. Bitcoin and Ethereum price outlook remains constructive for the year, with potential for substantial upside but with persistent tail risk of sharp drawdowns.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Notable Large Caps / Themes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia</strong>: Probable to take top spot by global market cap in 2025, cementing semis/AI as the leading sector.</li>
<li><strong>Meta &amp; Microsoft</strong>: Strong earnings outperform, maintain sector and index leadership.</li>
<li><strong>Apple &amp; Amazon</strong>: Facing credible antitrust actions, which could dampen relative performance; Apple less likely to regain market cap primacy in the near term.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla/Elon Musk</strong>: Ongoing speculation around Musk’s growing wealth and influence; Tesla faces unresolved regulatory and competitive headwinds.</li>
<li><strong>Trade-impacted names</strong>: Ford projects large tariff hit; similar caution warranted for autos, machinery, and multinationals with significant China/EU/Canada trade exposure.</li>
<li><strong>Live Nation</strong>: High probability of monopoly ruling may set precedent for ticketing and event industries; similar antitrust overhang possible for other vertically integrated consumer sectors.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Summary Investment Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Favor tech/AI mega caps and leading semiconductor plays</strong>, but be cognizant of regulatory and trade crosscurrents.</li>
<li><strong>Remain neutral-to-cautious on globally exposed industrials and autos</strong> due to tariff headwinds.</li>
<li><strong>Consider tail hedges for global risk events</strong> (Russia/Ukraine, currency, supply chain shocks), but do not overpay for extreme black swan protection.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor inflation and labor data closely</strong>—continued disinflation and steady employment underpin equities, while any break in trends may trigger rapid repricing across rates and real assets.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto and commodity exposure may offer outsized upside</strong>, but volatility and governance/trust risks remain; size accordingly.</li>
</ul>
