<h2>Macro &amp; US Economy</h2>
<h3>Growth, Inflation, and Monetary Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Market consensus strongly expects a &quot;soft landing&quot; for the US economy in 2025, with low recession, stagflation, or major crisis risk in the short term.</li>
<li>Core and headline inflation for 2025 are seen remaining in the 2.5–4% range—well above the Fed's target but not runaway. Sticky inflation persists, suggesting a “higher for longer” interest rate posture is favored by the Fed and markets.</li>
<li>Unemployment rates are expected to remain low through 2025, but projections for rises above 7% before 2030 are getting more attention. Current July 2025 readings hover around 4%, with a modest risk of increase but little sign of acute labor market stress for now.</li>
<li>US debt path remains worrying, but outright fiscal or payments crisis in 2025 is viewed as a low-probability scenario. Still, incremental pressure on rates (e.g., 10Y yield seen as fairly likely to touch or exceed 4.6–4.8% in 2025) could weigh on bond prices and wider market risk premium.</li>
<li>Fed rate cuts in 2025 are not widely expected—market does not anticipate more than one; a series of three cuts is considered unlikely barring a macro shock.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trade and the Dollar</h3>
<ul>
<li>Expanding tariffs (South Korea, Brazil) signal short-term protectionism and raise risks of retaliatory moves, inflation passthrough, and potential sectoral volatility (industrial, consumer, ag, EM FX).</li>
<li>The US dollar is projected to weaken (high odds for DXY dipping below 95 in 2025), potentially feeding into higher import prices and supporting risk assets/commodities, but also reflecting the perception of rising US fiscal imbalances.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Asset Classes</h2>
<h3>Equities—Indexes, Tech &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li>US large cap indices (notably S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100) are expected to end 2025 10–20% higher than current levels, with consensus for index closes in the 6,400–6,800 range; near-term volatility persists, but a major drop below 5,500 is seen as unlikely.</li>
<li>Elevated optimism around mega-cap tech persists as Microsoft and Meta continue to deliver on AI and cloud growth; NVDA is expected to take/retain the world’s largest market cap by year-end, implying sustained strength in semiconductor and AI-leader names.</li>
<li>AI platform race: Google, xAI, and OpenAI are the frontrunners for top model status by year-end; notable that Meta and Anthropic also receive substantial (but secondary) confidence. Barring regulatory shocks or model trust failures, sector investment flows remain robust.</li>
<li>Regulatory overhang (e.g., antitrust action, mandated AI safety bills) is present, but the outlook for forced large-scale breakups or policy-induced tech decoupling in 2025 is relatively limited versus past cycles.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Institutional adoption remains on an upswing: a new S&amp;P 500 company is virtually certain to add bitcoin to the balance sheet this year, and crypto ETF approvals (including for Ripple and DOGE) are seen as likely by year-end.</li>
<li>Bitcoin and Ethereum price targets are notably bullish, with BTC expected to retain levels well north of $80,000 and a credible possibility of $130,000 by late 2025; ETH has strong prospects for breaching $5,000, with some potential for new all-time highs above $6,000.</li>
<li>Sector risks include regulatory intervention, technical forks or upgrades stalling, but catastrophic price collapses are not the central scenario for 2025.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonds &amp; Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li>US Treasuries face continued yields pressure as fiscal uncertainty and inflation risk dominate; long duration still challenged but TIPS could gain relative favor with persistent inflation above target.</li>
<li>10Y Treasury yield breaching 4.6% this year is considered plausible; unlikely to dramatically overshoot toward 5% without new macro or fiscal shocks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commodities &amp; Energy/Climate</h3>
<ul>
<li>US renewables (especially solar) will keep expanding, but sector blowout years are unlikely; new installation volumes in 2025 should be solid, but not at record-setting pace.</li>
<li>Rising trade barriers (tariffs on Brazil, hints of more to come) could affect commodity supply chains, resulting in sporadic cost spikes (e.g., coffee, copper) and renewed scrutiny of EM exposure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>FX/Emerging Markets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Weakening Mexican peso and Brazilian real forecasts suggest flight from local EM currencies into USD will continue as US rates stay relatively high and trade risks rise. Countries reliant on US trade are now newly exposed to supply chain disruptions and cost inflation.</li>
<li>No acute risk of major EM currency crisis, but volatility may rise if US-China, US-Brazil, or US-Korea trade relations deteriorate further.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Specific Companies &amp; Themes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia (Mega-cap AI/Tech):</strong> Robust near-term growth, continued winner-take-most dynamic in AI. Surprises in earnings drive moves; regulatory action remains a future/slower-moving risk.</li>
<li><strong>Semiconductors (NVDA):</strong> Expected to surge in market cap/leadership, benefiting from AI infrastructure arms race.</li>
<li><strong>US Defense/Aerospace:</strong> Geopolitical risk is not acutely elevated, but elevated tension (Ukraine, South China Sea) supports a strong medium-term bid.</li>
<li><strong>SpaceX:</strong> High probability of record launches in 2025, signaling robust private space momentum.</li>
<li><strong>Bitcoin/Ethereum:</strong> High odds of remaining, and potentially growing, as institutional/investable assets, with little immediate risk of regulatory clampdown derailing industry expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer/Healthcare:</strong> Microplastics and GLP-1 obesity drugs are in the headlines; tail risk for companies exposed to litigation or input supply chains (CPG, pharma, environment).</li>
<li><strong>Trade-sensitive/Global Consumer:</strong> Heightened tariffs may negatively impact South Korean autos/electronics, Brazilian commodities, and US consumer multinationals with EM exposure.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Watchlist: Key Risks &amp; Catalysts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Escalating trade tensions and tariffs, especially if met with retaliation from Korea, Brazil, or others.</li>
<li>US fiscal trajectory and debt service costs, especially if inflation stays above 3%.</li>
<li>Fed surprise policy moves (e.g., inter-meeting hike/cut, due to global shock or market malfunction).</li>
<li>Geopolitical flare-ups (Ukraine, South China Sea, Israel-Turkey) that could suddenly reprioritize defense or energy trades.</li>
<li>Regulatory surprises in AI/tech or crypto.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Remain overweight AI/mega-cap tech, maintain exposure to crypto with the expectation of continued institutional adoption, and be wary of longer-duration bonds while inflation expectations remain sticky. Monitor trade-related headlines and shifts in emerging market currencies, as tariff policies and FX volatility may present new both risks and selective opportunities. Defensive positioning in commodities and inflation-linked assets may be prudent as trade and fiscal risks propagate through the global system. Regulatory and political risk bears watching, but is not the base case for sector-destroying events in 2025.</p>
