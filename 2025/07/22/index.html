<li><strong>Israel-Gaza Intensifies:</strong> Israeli operations expand in central Gaza, affecting humanitarian and U.N. facilities.</li>
<li><strong>Federal Jobs &amp; Politics:</strong> High likelihood of significant federal job cuts not materializing this year despite prior concerns.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro Outlook</h2>
<h3>Rates, Inflation, &amp; Fed Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inflation:</strong> The most likely trajectory keeps 2025 inflation in the 2.5%–3.5% range, with minimal probability of a major resurgence above 4%. Sticky inflation above 3% is slightly favored, powered by wage growth marginally outpacing inflation. Core CPI remains modestly elevated, limiting case for aggressive easing.</li>
<li><strong>Fed Policy:</strong> The Federal Reserve is highly likely to keep rates steady through 2025, with only a slim chance of either a cut larger than 25bps or a hike. Policy stability is expected, although ongoing references to tariffs, unemployment, and credit in Fed communications suggest heightened uncertainty and attention to external risks.</li>
<li><strong>Treasury Yields:</strong> 10-year yields are overwhelmingly likely to remain above 4%, with noticeable risk they test or briefly breach 4.6%. A spike to 5%+ is possible but not base case; the bond market is not pricing in a deep recession or rapid disinflation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Interest-rate sensitive assets (e.g., long-duration bonds, REITs) may remain under modest pressure; income strategies leaning into 2–10 year maturities could outperform ultra-long or very short-duration plays.</li>
<li>The “higher for longer” narrative looks intact for both policy rates and inflation, keeping inflation-protected assets and cash substitutes relevant.</li>
</ul>
<h3>GDP, Labor, &amp; Recession Risk</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>U.S. Economy:</strong> GDP growth is slowing but remains positive, with little expectation of contraction this year or next. Hard-landing recession risk has receded but has not disappeared (~2-in-5 investors anticipate a global or U.S. recession before 2027).</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market:</strong> Unemployment is ticking higher but will stay below 4.5%; new jobs creation is moderating. Tech sector layoffs are notably elevated versus 2024, aligning with margin management amidst AI investments and less benign financing costs.</li>
<li><strong>Real Wages:</strong> Wage growth is expected to at least keep pace with or slightly exceed inflation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Overall, a mild growth environment persists, with labor market gradual cooling; defensives and less-cyclical stocks favored for stability.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Policy, Fiscal &amp; Geopolitics</h2>
<h3>Trade, Tariffs, &amp; Global Relations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tariffs:</strong> There is near certainty of large and sweeping tariffs on major U.S. trading partners (China, South Korea, Mexico, Taiwan, EU, Japan, and Canada) by year-end, with specific new tariffs on copper and expanded goods. Sector and stock impacts (e.g., manufacturing, auto, hardware, retail) are front-loaded.</li>
<li><strong>Debt &amp; Fiscal:</strong> U.S. national debt is set to continue rising, passing $38 trillion this year and likely breaching new highs across this administration; debt ceiling raises are a given. Despite this, the market does not currently anticipate a significant shutdown or default, though the probability remains non-trivial.</li>
<li><strong>China &amp; EMs:</strong> The risk of China overtaking U.S. GDP by 2030 remains dismissed by most; current U.S.-China tensions (exit bans, tech/trade disputes) suggest further decoupling, keeping pressure on multinational earnings and FX markets.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Israel &amp; MENA:</strong> Israel’s campaign in Gaza is escalating, but domestic leadership changes are still not imminent.</li>
<li><strong>Ukraine:</strong> Weakening anti-corruption controls imperil Ukraine’s Western support, potentially lowering geopolitical risk premiums short-term but raising tail risks for a reversal of reforms or foreign aid interruptions.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Asset Classes</h2>
<h3>Equities &amp; Indices</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Broad Market Outlook:</strong> S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are expected to finish positive for the year but with headwinds from tariffs, cost inflation, and capex cycles (AI, energy transition). Outperformance is concentrated in large-cap tech and select defensives; cyclical exposure is more vulnerable.</li>
<li><strong>Meme/Speculative Moves:</strong> Volatility in meme-stocks/retail favorites can drive sharp, news-driven rallies in underloved names.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixed Income</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Government Bonds:</strong> 10Y yields are biased upward, while policy stability and ongoing budget deficits support upward pressure on real yields.</li>
<li><strong>TIPS/TIPZ:</strong> Elevated, sticky inflation expectations support inflation-protected strategies.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy:</strong> Oil prices are more likely to trend lower than higher this year; natural gas, meanwhile, shows signs of a higher price range, driven by supply dynamics.</li>
<li><strong>Base Metals:</strong> New copper tariffs are all but certain—supply chains likely to scramble, impacting manufacturing input costs (autos, electronics).</li>
<li><strong>Gold &amp; FX:</strong> No acute crisis driving flight-to-quality in gold or USD for now, but ongoing global and political volatility keeps an option on safe havens prominent.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Thematic/Second Order Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tech/AI Regulation and Competition:</strong> The U.S. is expected to relax some GPU/AI chip export controls, possibly boosting Nvidia and peers’ China sales. AI leadership is consolidating around U.S. giants (Google, xAI, Microsoft), with strong market support for further AI and cloud expansion. Tech labor market remains in churn as companies rebalance human vs. AI-driven resources.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate Guidance/Earnings:</strong> Tariffs and wages are front-and-center in upcoming earnings for GM, Apple, Amazon, and Tesla—expect continued margin pressure and shifting supply chains. Robotics, AI, and cloud remain the most cited growth vectors across mega-cap technology.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Transition:</strong> Solar capacity installations are proceeding but not breaking out to new highs. No systemic breakthrough in fusion within the investable horizon, keeping the status quo for renewables vs. fossil balance.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Stocks &amp; Company Specifics</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia</strong> is favored to become the world’s biggest company by year-end as AI momentum drives investor conviction. Earnings calls will stress sovereign/robotic verticals and China business.</li>
<li><strong>Apple</strong> earnings will highlight manufacturing shifts, heavy tariff uncertainty, and renewed push in wearables and AI.</li>
<li><strong>Google/Alphabet</strong> will focus on Gemini (AI), cloud, and regulatory issues in the EU.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon</strong> will heavily emphasize AI, AWS, supply chain resilience, and tariff management.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla</strong> is expected to double down on autonomy, margin management, tariffs, and manufacturing adaptation through earnings.</li>
<li><strong>GM</strong> and other U.S. automakers will continue to flag negative impacts from tariffs directly.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Actionable Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rebalance tech and manufacturing exposure based on tariff/supply chain risks and near-term cost pressures.</li>
<li>Consider upweighting inflation-resilient and defensively positioned equities.</li>
<li>Favor intermediate bonds/TIPS over long-dated treasuries.</li>
<li>Watch for value and reversal opportunities in retail/meme-driven names, but size positions appropriately to avoid excess volatility.</li>
<li>Monitor ongoing developments in U.S.-China relations and tariff implementation for additional volatility and sector rotation triggers.</li>
<li>Stay vigilant for signs of worsening labor market or sudden macro shocks (e.g., new pandemic wave, geopolitical escalations) as these could rapidly revive risk-off sentiment.</li>
</ul>
