<h1>Daily Memo (25-Jul-2025)</h1>
<h2>Top News Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>US/France Diplomatic Tensions:</strong> The US rejects France's formal recognition of Palestine; this is drawing strong reactions from regional powers, notably Saudi Arabia, with broader geopolitical implications for Middle East stability.</li>
<li><strong>Trade and Tariff Policy:</strong> Trump signals a high likelihood of imposing significant tariffs on multiple countries (China, EU, South Korea, Japan, Mexico, Canada, Taiwan); trade deal talks with the EU appear uncertain (50-50 chance).</li>
<li><strong>Government Legal Action:</strong> Columbia University agrees to a $221M settlement with the Trump administration over federal funding, spotlighting ongoing regulatory pressure on elite universities (Harvard facing increased scrutiny).</li>
<li><strong>Russian Economy:</strong> Russia cuts interest rates again as growth slows significantly, reflecting weakening economic momentum among some major adversaries.</li>
<li><strong>US Macroeconomic Strength:</strong> Solid earnings and trade optimism are lifting S&amp;P 500 and major indices to weekly highs, despite looming tariff deadlines.</li>
<li><strong>Federal Reserve:</strong> Ongoing White House pressure on Fed Chair Powell, as policy and rate cut expectations remain in focus.</li>
<li><strong>Middle East Conflict:</strong> Gaza remains under humanitarian crisis amid renewed US-Israel rejection of ceasefire talks, increasing geopolitical risk.</li>
<li><strong>Paramount-Skydance Merger:</strong> FCC approval of $8B merger paves way for major restructuring and likely hundreds of job cuts, with strategic implications for US media giants and regulatory landscape.</li>
<li><strong>Asia Flashpoint:</strong> Armed conflict escalates between Thailand and Cambodia, with potential spillover for neighboring economies and global supply chains.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro and Geopolitical Thesis</h2>
<h3>Economic Growth, Inflation &amp; Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>US GDP and Economic Cycle:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Growth remains moderate (~1.5–2.5% most probable); risk of outright US or global recession before 2027 is less than half but not negligible.</li>
<li>Core and headline inflation are widely expected to remain above 3% into late 2025, with upside risk (4%+) meaningfully on the table. The odds of headline prints &gt;5% are low but not zero—this keeps pressure on real yields and rate expectations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Federal Reserve Outlook:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Market consensus favors 1–2 Fed rate cuts by year-end; a hike or emergency action is seen as highly unlikely barring unforeseen shocks.</li>
<li>Ongoing political tension/pressure on Powell, but no strong signs of imminent shakeup in Fed leadership.</li>
<li>US government spending continues to expand, with $38T+ debt load seen as baseline, and little credible momentum for meaningful austerity in the near term.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Government Shutdown &amp; Sovereign Risk</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a significant chance of a US government shutdown this year, raising episodic volatility risk for Treasuries, IG credit, and select rate-sensitive sectors (especially agencies, REITs, MBS).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Currency &amp; De-Dollarization:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>USD index is seen vulnerable to new yearly lows, with ongoing talk of de-dollarization and substantial foreign policy tensions. However, major systemic shocks (e.g. USD demise, USDC/Tether de-peg) are considered very low probability for this year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Global Growth/Adversaries:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>China overtaking the US by GDP by 2030 is considered plausible but not consensus, with still-meaningful emerging market inflation and FX risks (notably USD/BRL seen drifting higher).</li>
<li>Russian economic deceleration and Asia border conflicts (Thailand-Cambodia) add to “tail risk” for global supply chains and energy prices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inflation &amp; Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inflation Regimes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Core inflation is likeliest to persist in a 3–4% range; risks of resurgent inflation (&gt;5%) are relatively low, but persistent upside pressures from tariffs and political uncertainty exist.</li>
<li>Gasoline prices expected to stay volatile, especially in regions like Texas ($3+/gal likely) and California (staying above $4/gal). WTI oil is set to remain rangebound but vulnerable to downside ($65–$75), barring an OPEC production move or geopolitical shock.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trade, Tariffs, and Global Supply Chains</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trade Policy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nearly certain imposition of new US tariffs (Trump administration) this year on China, EU, Canada, Mexico, Japan, South Korea, and likely other major partners. Revenue from tariffs is expected to be substantial, although the odds of Congress passing supporting legislation are low.</li>
<li>Risk of semiconductor and pharma tariffs is material, signaling direct impacts to supply chains, input costs, and earnings for these key sectors.</li>
<li>Probability of Trump administration attempting to exit the WTO or USMCA this year is low but nontrivial, possibly amplifying uncertainty in auto/industrial supply chains.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Second-Order Effects:</strong> Expect retaliatory tariffs, disruptions in global goods flows, elevated input/consumer prices (potentially fueling core inflation), and renewed volatility in export-driven sectors.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Style Implications</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; Semiconductors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sector Outlook:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tech sector faces significant labor cost rationalizations; ongoing tech layoffs likely to exceed prior years, boosting margins but possibly denting sentiment.</li>
<li>US semiconductor output is set for robust growth (&gt;7%), even as trade and tariff risks loom; exposure to China/EU demand and tariffs must be managed carefully.</li>
<li>Semiconductor tariffs may drive short-term volatility for US/Asian chipmakers and hardware exporters, but could also accelerate domestic capex and &quot;reshoring&quot; themes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Clean Energy &amp; Utilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solar Installations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>US solar capacity growth will be strong, though unlikely to shatter prior highs—most probable outcome is 30–40GW new capacity. Incremental momentum for utilities/solar manufacturing, tempered by tariff and supply chain pressures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>O&amp;G &amp; Commodities:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Oil prices at risk for sharp moves (both ways), contingent on OPEC cuts, global demand, and destabilizing events (Gaza, Thailand/Cambodia, Russia). Downside scenarios for oil are prominent, which generally benefits oil importers and consumer spending but hurts energy equities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tariff/Policy Risk:</strong>
<ul>
<li>There’s a material risk of tariffs hitting pharma imports, impacting healthcare supply chains and potentially boosting US healthcare inflation.</li>
<li>Watch for further government intervention in university finances and sector scrutiny following big settlements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mainstream Adoption &amp; Volatility:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Institutional interest continues to rise, with additional S&amp;P 500 companies potentially adding Bitcoin and prospects for new ETFs (Ripple, Doge) gaining regulatory traction.</li>
<li>Crypto price ranges remain wide, but new all-time highs in leading tokens (especially Bitcoin, Ethereum) are probable in the medium term, albeit with significant retracement/drawdown risk.</li>
<li>Major stablecoin de-peggings and systemic crypto crises remain a tail risk but are not central expectations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Company Highlights &amp; Special Situations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paramount/Skydance:</strong> Approaching merger completion, with job cuts expected; could drive portfolio rotation within US media and content producers.</li>
<li><strong>Apple/Samsung:</strong> Product cycles (e.g., iOS 26, Galaxy Z Fold/Flip 7) continue to drive headlines, reinforcing consumer electronics sector leadership but underscoring competitive intensity.</li>
<li><strong>SpaceX:</strong> Regulatory and punitive actions by US administration possible, introducing idiosyncratic risk to aerospace/defense industry players tied to high-profile private contractors.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Actionable Focus</strong>: Prepare for volatility in response to tariff headlines, Fed guidance, and ongoing labor market normalization; continue to favor domestically-levered, high-margin sectors. Remain alert for “risk-off” shocks emerging from government shutdown, global conflicts, or sudden repricing of inflation/growth trajectories. Watch the labor cost and tech layoff trends for implications on index earnings and capex. In crypto and digital assets, favor selective, liquid exposures over aggressive position-taking due to ongoing regulatory/policy whipsaw risk.</p>
