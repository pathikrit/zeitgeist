<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Global Outlook</h2>
<h3>US Economy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soft Landing Consensus:</strong> Market expectations point toward a soft landing through year-end, with a low probability assigned to 2025 US GDP growth above 3%, and moderate likelihood of continued sub-3% inflation. Unemployment in the 4–4.5% range is likely, with fears of recession dampened but not eliminated. There is strong anticipation of modest wage growth outpacing inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Fed Policy:</strong> The majority view is for no significant (&gt;25bps) Fed rate cuts this year; dissent within Fed meetings is expected, reflecting underlying policy uncertainty but no imminent major easing. Yield curve is likely to remain flat or slightly inverted, favoring shorter-duration fixed income and TIPS during policy ambiguity.</li>
<li><strong>Government Spending &amp; Debt:</strong> Despite political rhetoric around large cuts, actual near-term reduction in spending is unlikely. The overall US national debt is set to climb above $38T by year’s end, with little chance of meaningful budget tightening before 2026.</li>
<li><strong>Global Recession Watch:</strong> The probability for a near-term IMF-declared global recession remains below 50%, but Japan and UK are seen as at high risk of downturn this cycle, with Germany exposed. These markets look relatively vulnerable in the medium term.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trade, Tariffs, and Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tariff Regime Shift:</strong> A sharp uptick in US protectionism is priced in, with broad-based tariffs expected on allies (Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, EU) as well as China. Copper and semiconductor imports are direct targets, likely raising input costs across supply chains, hitting manufacturing, and further fueling regional inflation.</li>
<li><strong>US Dollar &amp; FX:</strong> The USD Index may drift lower, but not drastically so; short-term weakening versus EM and select majors is plausible as trade frictions bite and capital flows adjust. The Mexican peso is expected to weaken meaningfully.</li>
<li><strong>Energy &amp; Commodity Prices:</strong> Oil prices exhibit an unanchored outlook, but lean toward downside risk for the year—sub-$65/bbl WTI is strongly anticipated, with little chance of spikes above $90. Natural gas, however, faces upward price pressure fueled by global demand and supply chain constraints. Commodities tied to tariffs (copper, semiconductors) could see price spikes and inventory hoarding.</li>
<li><strong>EU Dynamics:</strong> The European Union may expand before decade’s end but also harbors moderate risk of a member departure; this adds FX and regional uncertainty to medium-term European equity and sovereign debt plays.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors: Implications &amp; Second-Order Effects</h2>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Big Tech/Platform Risk:</strong> Upcoming US regulatory and antitrust actions pose rising threats, especially to Apple and Amazon, with courts increasingly receptive to monopoly arguments. Apple is under particular scrutiny, increasing headline/legal risk premium. OpenAI’s future remains uncertain but is unlikely to upend competitive dynamics this year.</li>
<li><strong>Semiconductors:</strong> Rapid US domestic chip capacity expansion expected, but global supply chains at risk from tariffs, especially between US and Asian producers. European and Asian chip names could lag; US firms with US-centric fabs favored.</li>
<li><strong>Media/Entertainment:</strong> Paramount-Skydance deal is emblematic; more media M&amp;A activity expected as traditional and streaming consolidate, benefiting sector incumbents and PE/VC dealmakers. Content proliferation continues, but viewer fragmentation/competition erodes margins.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer Tech:</strong> Apple’s positive software/hardware cycle, Samsung/Google launches hint at near-term hardware demand support. However, trade and security risk cloud revenue outlook for global hardware plays.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Industrials, Commodities, and Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defense:</strong> Missile defense shortfalls highlight investment case for US and allied defense names specializing in manufacturing interceptors, electronics, and smart munitions. Replenishment spending likely to surge, favoring contractors.</li>
<li><strong>Energy:</strong> Oil supermajors face weak price realizations, and renewables continue to gain share, but fossil fuels (highly, coal) remain structurally important through 2030. Modern biofuels/solar will continue to grow, but with slower-than-expected global displacement of hydrocarbons.</li>
<li><strong>Industrial Inputs:</strong> Tariffs and rising trade friction set to disrupt supply chains; sectors with global input exposure (auto, heavy machinery, select pharma and chemical) will likely experience cost pressure and profit margin volatility.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Health, Public Policy, and Regulation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Rising U.S. infectious disease incidence (measles, whooping cough, possible polio return) elevates public health spending; vaccine and infectious disease testing companies may be near-term beneficiaries. Policy shift to ban transgender athletes is imminent, raising ongoing legal and healthcare administration questions.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental/Climate:</strong> Microplastics regulation is gaining policy traction, which could impose new compliance costs on food/ag and diversified consumer names.</li>
<li><strong>Education:</strong> Declining US math and reading scores indicate exposure in edtech and higher education service providers; increased government and private focus on interventions possible.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company and Asset-Specific Risk/Opportunity</h2>
<h3>Mega-Cap Tech &amp; Wealth Concentration</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wealth gap implications:</strong> Concentration continues to favor mega-cap tech and founders (Tesla, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Google), though legal/antitrust/sentiment headwinds are strong. Tesla’s recent earnings and management communication reveal mounting operational and investor sentiment risk.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Banks:</strong> JPMorgan’s CEO succession planning tilts toward Marianne Lake, but probability of an abrupt Jamie Dimon exit remains low in 2025. Sector remains relatively defensively positioned, but long-term regulatory risk persists.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto/Blockchain</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin/Ethereum:</strong> Both are expected to remain robust or rise from here; meaningful downside risk is limited, while major upside spikes remain possible but not consensus. Stablecoin (Tether) depeg risk is present but not urgent.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Scrutiny:</strong> No severe dislocation anticipated in short term, but regulatory and legal risks continue to surface.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Actions to Watch / Key Themes Moving Forward</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Positioning:</strong> Underweight broad international equities exposed to new US tariffs/trade friction; overweight US-centric defense, select tech, and domestic manufacturing.</li>
<li><strong>Hedging:</strong> Consider risk hedges on USD and EM FX, with watch on peso vulnerability.</li>
<li><strong>Event Watch:</strong> Monitor upcoming Fed meetings for hints of policy pivot, Supreme Court decisions on social/gender policy with potential to shift healthcare and education sectors, and escalating conflicts in Southeast Asia and the Middle East as tail risk triggers.</li>
<li><strong>M&amp;A and Regulatory:</strong> Active M&amp;A environment continues and legal scrutiny on tech intensifies; increased volatility in directly-impacted names.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong><br />
Market participants face a complex web of macro risks: shifting US trade policy, protectionism, uneven global growth, and increasing legal and regulatory headwinds for mega-cap tech. Energy and commodity prices show divergent risks—oil pressured, metals volatile. Defensives, select tech, and domestics seem most robust short-term, but the underlying backdrop is one of elevated headline sensitivity and policy-driven asset rotation.</p>
