</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro Overview</h2>
<h3>US Macro &amp; Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growth:</strong> Soft landing scenario still expected as base case; moderate GDP growth likely through Q2/Q3 2025. Market does not anticipate deep recession, with only limited probability of a downturn this year.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Persistent inflation above 3% expected for the remainder of 2025. Risks of &quot;higher-for-longer&quot; scenario remain, with little support for aggressive rate cuts or hikes.</li>
<li><strong>Unemployment:</strong> Unemployment will likely remain elevated near or above 4%, with further tech and corporate layoffs feeding through to labor market softness.</li>
<li><strong>Fed Policy:</strong> Market expects, at most, one or two rate cuts this year, mostly due to slowing growth rather than a crisis. Odds of emergency measures remain low.</li>
</ul>
<h3>US Policy &amp; Trade</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tariffs:</strong> Sweeping tariffs on key trading partners—China, Mexico, Korea, Canada, Taiwan, EU—expected to be imposed this year. Downstream impacts may include:
<ul>
<li>Higher input costs for US industry</li>
<li>Disrupted supply chains (especially tech, autos, industrials)</li>
<li>Retaliatory tariffs impacting multinationals' top-line growth</li>
<li>Support for US onshoring, especially semiconductors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Risk:</strong> National debt expected to cross $38T by year-end; Sovereign wealth fund remains a tail event, but fiscal expansion persists.</li>
<li><strong>Social Policy:</strong> SNAP benefits at risk of cuts; homelessness policy, housing, and welfare under pressure, with political volatility around entitlement reform.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Macro</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>EUR &amp; Europe:</strong> EU expansion likely, but member attrition/exit remains a second-order risk. France's recognition of Palestinian state may drive near-term political ruffles within the EU.</li>
<li><strong>FX:</strong> De-dollarization pressure mounting; USD index faces downside risk, but not a major collapse. Key EM FX (MXN, BRL) expected to weaken.</li>
<li><strong>China:</strong> Odds remain against China overtaking the US by 2030, but trade/FX volatility likely to persist.</li>
<li><strong>India &amp; Emerging Markets:</strong> India likely to meet 2030 climate goals, signaling stable policy environment and infrastructure investment tailwinds.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Themes</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; Semiconductors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Semiconductors:</strong> US domestic semiconductor production surging (&gt;7% growth expected), aided by tariffs and supply chain reshoring; positive for domestic semi-caps. However, Intel's layoffs signal bifurcation between newer/faster US fabs and legacy manufacturing.</li>
<li><strong>Big Tech:</strong> AI regulation in focus; moderate risk of direct government intervention in AI startups. Tech labor market remains tight, but tech layoffs are increasingly widespread.</li>
<li><strong>Mega-cap Power:</strong> Concentration of wealth and market cap in a handful of US tech names remains prominent. Nvidia favored to finish year as largest-cap company, but volatility persists as sector multiples remain high.</li>
<li><strong>Hardware:</strong> Apple progressing toward foldables, software integration remains a moat; hardware innovation still a value driver.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy, Commodities &amp; Climate</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil and Gas:</strong> Short-term downward pressure on oil, but gas price spikes likely in US states with supply bottlenecks. Strategic petroleum reserve levels stable but low. Trump tariffs on metals (copper) and energy inputs to create volatility in global supply chains.</li>
<li><strong>Clean Energy:</strong> US, EU unlikely to hit climate goals for 2030, but India tracking ahead. Solar installations remain strong in the US, though less than the most bullish forecasts. Coal demand likely to persist globally in the near term.</li>
<li><strong>Nuclear/Next-Gen Power:</strong> No near-term breakthrough for nuclear fusion. However, US interest in small-scale military nuclear and nuclear-powered data centers points to longer-term upside for nuclear tech providers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Biotech</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Healthcare Cost Pressure:</strong> Ongoing DOJ scrutiny into insurers (e.g., UnitedHealth) and downward pricing pressure on insulin and GLP-1 (Ozempic) drugs.</li>
<li><strong>Drug Innovation:</strong> Low probability of a Type 1 diabetes cure approval before 2033. Policy moves against pharma monopolies have weak legislative prospects in the near-term.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Estate</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Urban Rents:</strong> NYC and San Francisco rents remain expected to rise, supported by supply/demand imbalance. Real estate-related equities likely to reflect this trend.</li>
<li><strong>Federal Properties:</strong> Limited movement expected in major US government property sales.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum:</strong> Anticipate continued volatility, with a bullish bias (expecting new highs for both by year-end, but with real downside risk). Another S&amp;P 500 company likely to add Bitcoin to its treasury. USDT depegging or insolvency risk is low but not zero.</li>
<li><strong>Coinbase:</strong> Trading volume set to remain robust; watch for regulatory and market structure news affecting revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Regulation:</strong> No evidence of systemic regulatory crackdown or circuit breaker-level volatility.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company/Name-Specific Insights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia:</strong> Leading candidate to remain largest public company, benefiting from AI and accelerated US chip production.</li>
<li><strong>Intel:</strong> Cost-cutting and offshoring signal competitive pressures; neutral to negative near-term for the name.</li>
<li><strong>UnitedHealth:</strong> DOJ probe an overhang—sentiment negative, potential broader implications for managed care space.</li>
<li><strong>Apple:</strong> Ongoing product innovation, transition to foldable devices, and robust ecosystem integration.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla:</strong> No expected CEO departures or major disruptions. However, ongoing scrutiny of labor, regulatory, or competitive pressures.</li>
<li><strong>Paramount:</strong> FCC approval of merger provides positive M&amp;A and industry consolidation signal for media.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Not expected to hit AGI milestones or see a CEO change this year; AI regulatory climate remains a watch item.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Second/Third Order Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li>Supply chain fallout from tariffs could drive inflation on US-manufactured goods and limit disinflationary trend.</li>
<li>Persistent mega-cap concentration may eventually prompt antitrust policy or &quot;wealth tax&quot; policy risk.</li>
<li>Heightened global volatility on the back of EU, Middle East, and US domestic politics could feed through to FX and global indices.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Key Watch Items This Week:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reactions to new tariffs: corporate earnings calls, cost guidance, supply chain commentary.</li>
<li>Labor market data, especially in tech and industrial sector.</li>
<li>Healthcare pricing and M&amp;A signals after UnitedHealth and Paramount announcements.</li>
<li>Any escalation in Middle East or EU geopolitics.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Remain diversified across sectors and geographies, as policy and macro whiplash risk remains elevated.</strong></p>
