<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; US Market Regime</h2>
<h3>Economic Growth &amp; Inflation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Growth is expected to moderate: US GDP growth and unemployment forecasts suggest a &quot;soft landing&quot; remains likely, despite some risk of elevated unemployment. Recession odds have lessened but are not negligible.</li>
<li>Inflation is likely to remain sticky but off extremes: The consensus is for inflation to trend between 2.5%–4%. Core inflation will probably run above the Fed target but below recent peaks; a deflationary or runaway scenario is low probability.</li>
<li>Fed funds rates should stay elevated, with a downward bias but not rapidly: Most expect rates to move gradually lower, with the most likely scenario being one to two cuts in 2025. Large-scale/emergency moves look unlikely unless a shock occurs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal &amp; Debt</h3>
<ul>
<li>National debt is rising faster than nominal GDP, climbing toward or above $38T by year-end. Fiscal tightening or major spending cuts are not anticipated in the near term. This may support ongoing upward pressure on yields at longer durations, and keep debt-ceiling headlines in play.</li>
<li>The dollar is likely to remain range-bound with downward pressure: Prospects for de-dollarization are increasingly discussed, with risk of the USD index breaking materially lower in late 2025 if global diversification accelerates.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trade &amp; Tariffs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Major trade disruptions ahead: New US tariffs are expected toward China, Taiwan, Mexico, Canada, South Korea, and the EU. Retaliatory tariffs (especially from China, EU, Brazil) are also increasingly likely. Expect cross-border supply chain volatility, especially in autos, semis, and metals (notably copper).</li>
<li>Trade deals with Japan remain contentious, keeping dollar–yen, auto, and manufacturing sector risks elevated.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Thematic Highlights</h2>
<h3>Technology, AI &amp; Semiconductors</h3>
<ul>
<li>US semiconductor production is on a strong growth path, outpacing most other industrial sectors. AI compute continues to intensify, but leading US models face stiffer competition from Chinese and EU players.</li>
<li>Tech sector layoffs suggest overcapacity or at least slower revenue growth expectations; wage pressures may abate, but near-term consumer demand remains firm.</li>
<li>Several global AI leaders are likely to emerge, especially from US names (Google, OpenAI/xAI) and potentially emerging players (Anthropic, Deepseek). Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Nvidia will remain primary growth and policy drivers, but broader sector allocation should account for AI’s increasingly global distribution.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy, Commodities &amp; Transition</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fossil fuel use (especially coal) is expected to remain dominant through 2030, despite strong renewables growth in capacity. Oil prices are projected to remain volatile but with a downward bias for WTI, although spot and regional (California, Texas) gasoline price spikes remain a risk as extreme weather and geopolitics persist.</li>
<li>US solar is adding large headline capacity, but will not supplant coal in the near term.</li>
<li>Growing focus on nuclear for infrastructure resilience (e.g., data centers on military bases) supports investment in long-duration, inflation-insulated utility plays.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Pharma</h3>
<ul>
<li>Drug pricing pressures are intensifying: Insulin and GLP-1 drug (Ozempic) prices are likely to fall, as are select specialty generics, with additional regulation or payer action likely.</li>
<li>Psychedelics and new FDA approvals are likely in the coming year, creating both alpha opportunities (early-stage biotech) and more volatility for large-cap pharma.</li>
<li>Watch for infectious disease flare-ups and new vaccine developments, but these are not likely broad market movers in the near term; exception would be a genuine new pandemic.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials</h3>
<ul>
<li>Succession planning across major banks (notably JPMorgan) could spur volatility or price reaction if announcements diverge from expectations.</li>
<li>Regulatory risk for large payments, banking, and consumer finance (Apple, Amazon, others) is increasing, especially around monopoly or antitrust outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Key Individual Names &amp; Risk Events</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Musk/Tesla/SpaceX</strong>: Tesla equity sentiment turning bearish, with weak sales and Musk’s declining wealth positioning. SpaceX remains strategically important but is less likely to deliver near-term public market catalysts.</li>
<li><strong>Apple</strong>: Regulatory scrutiny around monopoly power, software refresh cycle; CEO succession risk remains low.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon</strong>: Antitrust headlines likely to escalate; CEO turnover risk low for now.</li>
<li><strong>Live Nation</strong>: Litigation/regulation risk is high; structural change or forced restructuring is plausible in the coming years.</li>
<li><strong>JPMorgan</strong>: CEO handover possible in medium term, but not viewed as disruptive in the near term given advanced succession planning.</li>
<li><strong>Large tech</strong> (Google, Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI/xAI): Innovation continues, but competitive dynamics (especially in AI) are shifting rapidly. Expect continued regulatory, product, and workforce volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto</strong>: Bitcoin and Ethereum remain buoyant, with a real chance of more public company and sovereign allocations; extreme price targets remain longshots, but $100K+ for BTC and $4K+ for ETH look increasingly credible as institutional adoption broadens.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Second/Third-Order Implications</h2>
<ul>
<li>Higher for longer rates and sticky inflation likely support asset-light models and hard assets over high CAPEX/long-duration plays across public markets.</li>
<li>Energy and materials sectors likely to experience greater price volatility due to trade wars, with metals (e.g., copper) seeing tariff-driven swings.</li>
<li>Ongoing tech layoffs may pressure commercial real estate, regional banking, and consumer discretionary sectors.</li>
<li>Increasing policy and regulatory risks for large-cap consumer, e-commerce, and media names.</li>
<li>Cyclical shifts toward nearshoring and supply chain diversification (especially US, Mexico, Canada, and selected Asian markets) offer sector-level alpha opportunities and hedging enhanced by ongoing global tensions.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Summary Investment Outlook</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Macro</strong>: Base case is one of moderate US growth, above-target but non-runaway inflation, and “higher for longer” rate dynamics; possible soft landing.</li>
<li><strong>Sector allocation</strong>: Favor quality/defensive tech, AI/cyber infra, US manufacturing/semiconductors, utilities with inflation protection; maintain select positions in broad healthcare and energy.</li>
<li><strong>Key risks</strong>: Policy whiplash on trade, geopolitics (especially East Asia and Middle East), litigation, and mounting regulatory interventions in tech and consumer sectors. Strained global alliances and potential for new, material supply shocks remain non-negligible.</li>
<li><strong>Alpha opportunities</strong>: Next-generation AI tech (but diversify beyond the largest US names), nuclear/utility infrastructure, US dollar alternatives (select EMFX, crypto, gold), and innovative healthcare.</li>
<li><strong>Hedge themes</strong>: Remain nimble on rates, watch for volatility spikes tied to political or trade shocks, use inflation-linked instruments where appropriate, and diversify geographically amidst dollar and supply chain transitions.</li>
