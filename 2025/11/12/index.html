<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Rates</h2>
<h3>Government Shutdown Resolution and Fiscal Outlook</h3>
<ul>
<li>The longstanding government shutdown appears set to end, bringing immediate relief to federal workers, service providers, and risk assets. However, budget wrangling and the passage of funding bills highlight ongoing fiscal and partisan risks.</li>
<li>Travel/aviation disruptions persist and may have a drag effect on economic data, especially in the services sector.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inflation &amp; Labor Market</h3>
<ul>
<li>Core and headline inflation are likely to persist near or modestly above 3% into late 2025; a soft landing remains the base case.</li>
<li>Unemployment remains near cycle lows but tech sector layoffs are set to outpace last year.</li>
<li>Structural wage growth appears to outpace inflation for now. However, SNAP funding and cost-of-living pressures on the lower-income consumer signal no &quot;all clear&quot; for broad-based consumer strength.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Central Bank Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Fed is poised for multiple rate cuts in the year ahead but is not expected to tighten; global central banks (ECB, BOE, BOJ) maintain or initiate dovish tilts too.</li>
<li>Risks from future leadership changes at the Fed and political interference (rates, balance sheet runoff) linger, especially with election-year dynamics.</li>
<li>Treasury yields have moderate downside potential as recession risk remains low and inflation expectations well-anchored. Supply remains heavy on the long end given projected deficits.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitics &amp; Global Macro</h2>
<h3>Europe &amp; G7</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Germany/UK recession risk remains elevated, while the EU is facing its own challenges in reaching climate and fiscal goals.</li>
<li>The risk of new trade barriers remains a live issue—retaliatory tariffs or subsidy tit-for-tat could flare.</li>
<li>Macron is under pressure at home, potentially increasing political volatility across broader European indices and EUR/USD.</li>
</ul>
<h3>US-China, Asia, and EM</h3>
<ul>
<li>US-China geopolitics is unsettled; any shift toward aggressive tariffs (especially on semis or tech) would disrupt global supply chains, tech and industrials.</li>
<li>RMB, TWD, KRW all face headline risk from trade disputes, while Japan’s snap election risk underscores JPY volatility.</li>
<li>India continues on a steady growth and reform path, with strong progress toward climate goals and a stable EM story apart from regional security incidents (India-Pakistan, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<h3>MENA &amp; Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Middle East remains tense: Russia-Ukraine war, Israel-Hamas, and Iran variables keep defense/energy risk premia elevated. However, the base case remains no all-out contagion to oil markets, even as isolated shocks are possible.</li>
<li>Oil/gas demand growth projected to extend into 2050 by the IEA but with caveats around global economic growth and climate policies.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Themes</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li>US tech sector shows resilience; major indices near highs, with ongoing leadership from mega-cap names, especially NVDA, which is likely to retain the world’s largest market cap through year-end.</li>
<li>AI remains a powerful driver of capex, revenue, and narrative. Both tech companies and retailers (e.g., Walmart) are shouting about AI, automation, and omnichannel.</li>
<li>Legal risks simmer in the background (AI/copyright, antitrust scrutiny). SCOTUS poised to address some of these, but near-term disruption limited.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consumer, Retail, &amp; Health</h3>
<ul>
<li>Elevated attention to SNAP, automation, and cost inflation in retail—Walmart and others flag legacy and ‘omnichannel’ consumer resilience, but low-end budgets are stretched.</li>
<li>Ongoing outbreak risk (measles, whooping cough) and access to hormone therapies (FDA ruling) are reshaping US healthcare and pharma dynamics.</li>
<li>Tech layoffs don’t yet suggest consumer recession but could drag on discretionary and housing sectors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy, Commodities, and Climate</h3>
<ul>
<li>Climate volatility is underscored by ongoing record heat, severe solar storms, and expectations for above-3°C global temp rises by 2050—a tailwind for insurance, agri-tech and commodities volatility.</li>
<li>Renewables ramp, but oil/gas demand longer tail than some expected; commodities inflation could resurge if MENA shocks or China accelerates.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Alternatives &amp; Crypto</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gold considered likely to outperform Bitcoin this year; BTC/ETH volatility remains high.</li>
<li>Institutional crypto adoption is slow; regulatory clarity is lacking but improving.</li>
<li>Stablecoin de-peg/insolvency risk is low but remains newsworthy and worth monitoring for systemic contagion events.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company-Specific Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>NVDA</strong> is expected to hold market cap leadership; AI, data center, and hyperscaler mentions dominate upcoming earnings.</li>
<li><strong>AAPL</strong> faces slowing device sales, but is exploring hardware/services upgrades; product pipeline remains highly watched.</li>
<li><strong>TSLA</strong> deliveries likely to be strong but expensive FSD and robotaxi milestones face skepticism.</li>
<li><strong>WMT</strong> and <strong>DIS</strong> earnings will highlight cost-conscious high-end consumer resilience, streaming transition, and possible M&amp;A.</li>
<li>Look for renewed M&amp;A in media (Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery in play).</li>
<li>Ongoing legal battles for big tech (Google’s cybercrime lawsuits, antitrust) support continued regulatory overhang.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Second-Order Effects &amp; Action Items</h2>
<ul>
<li>Be alert for further Fed leadership, regulatory, and congressional policy surprises as the US approaches election season; these could change the bond curve and risk appetite.</li>
<li>Watch for snapback in inflation if travel, tariffs, or supply chain shocks re-emerge, potentially reversing the “soft landing” narrative.</li>
<li>Tech sector beat-and-raise cycle appears intact—lean into AI/hyperscaler stories but beware valuation multiples and litigation overhangs.</li>
<li>Energy/commodities exposure remains important; downside on gas/oil is limited by supply/geo constraints, while upside risks remain for insurance/ag/renewables from climate disruption.</li>
<li>Recession remains a risk into 2026, more for Europe/UK than for the US in the base case.</li>
<li>Monitor public health news flow—not as market-moving as COVID, but outbreaks can sharpen sector rotation quickly.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><em>For portfolio construction: Maintain balance between US equities (large-cap/tech/AI), alternatives for inflation/bond hedging, and selective exposure to energy and defense sectors. Stay selective in consumer and cyclicals; overweight tech sector short-term, underweight Europe/UK, overweight energy and insurance for climate/geopolitical risk.</em></p>
