</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro Overview</h2>
<h3>US Policy &amp; Fiscal</h3>
<ul>
<li>Government shutdown appears on track to end, but <strong>signals persistent political dysfunction</strong>. Tourist, transport, and consumer disruptions provide a meaningful temporary drag on economic activity.</li>
<li>Fiscal discussions center on <strong>debate over SNAP, ACA, and new mortgage structures</strong>. If a 50-year mortgage is adopted, long-term demand support for housing is possible but with higher structural risk.</li>
<li><strong>Tariffs: Trump proposes a direct &quot;dividend&quot; to consumers</strong>. If implemented, could be highly inflationary (especially to goods/services exposed to import costs), but election-year politics may blunt legislative follow-through in the near term.</li>
<li>Government spending will rise significantly near-term, sustaining demand but at cost of further debt growth. Debt trajectory remains concerning leading into 2026.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rates, Inflation, and Labor</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fed still seen likely to cut rates into 2025</strong> (3+ cuts increasingly consensus). Market pricing implies cuts rather than hikes through 2026 barring a volatility shock or massive inflation jump.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation expectations anchored near 3%</strong> through 2025, with little conviction for runaway inflation (energy, food remain potential wildcards). Wages likely to grow slightly ahead of CPI—supporting consumer health.</li>
<li><strong>Unemployment risk remains lower near-term</strong>, but macro scenarios imply some rise in joblessness into 2026-27 (not acute yet). Near-term risk is to upside for jobs numbers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics &amp; Global</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Middle East instability persists</strong>: Israel-Gaza, Lebanon, Iran risks remain elevated. Substantial moves in oil/defense stocks if escalation occurs, but market not pricing new war as base case.</li>
<li><strong>China supply chain risk abates marginally</strong> (Nexperia example), but tariffs and tech decoupling continue to drive medium/long-term reallocation of supply chains (semiconductors, EVs, renewables).</li>
<li><strong>Russia/Ukraine:</strong> No ceasefire likely this year, Russian advances possible but not game-changing for global risk assets in short term.</li>
<li><strong>European energy and currency risks</strong>: Significant probability of German/UK/Japanese recessions, Eurozone hiking/cutting cycle appears limited, and currency volatility remains a function of US growth/ECB posture.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Asset Classes</h2>
<h3>Equities &amp; Indices</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Indices</strong> (S&amp;P/Nasdaq/Russell): Bias remains positive in near-term on shutdown resolution and Fed cut expectations. Tech, cloud, and growth-led sectors are reflecting risk-on sentiment.</li>
<li><strong>Mega-cap tech (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Google, Tesla, Meta)</strong>: Short-term volatility possible but leadership transitions/earnings beats/hardware cycles supportive for now. Nvidia dominant. Tech remains market leadership driver.</li>
<li><strong>Small caps/Russell 2000</strong> could benefit if rate-cut narrative persists, but political/fiscal risk and credit environment remain a headwind.</li>
<li><strong>Financials/banking</strong>: No acute risk of crisis/bailout, but modest underperformance likely as a function of sluggish loan growth and policy uncertainty.</li>
<li><strong>Real Estate (REITs)</strong>: Outlook modestly improves with rate-cut expectation, but regional/fiscal stress, and demographic headwinds, especially in LA, Miami, and Chicago, imply selective exposure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commodities &amp; Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil and Gas</strong>: Near-term oil/gas prices look capped. Geopolitical premium exists, but lack of escalation is keeping energy prices from overheating. Long-term structural demand remains, but green transition is persistent.</li>
<li><strong>Gold</strong>: Risk-off hedge still in demand. Outperformance vs. crypto likely in 2025 given macro backdrop and absence of runaway inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Agriculture/Food</strong>: Storms and supply chain disruptions raise risk in selected soft commodities. Egg prices and farm goods may see above-CPI price increases.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology &amp; Disruptive Sectors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI &amp; Semiconductors</strong>: AI is driving broad tech success (NVDA, MSFT, GOOG). No Supreme Court-level AI legislation imminent, but regulatory rumblings may pop later in 2026. Chips remain a critical strategic asset, with secondary effects for autos, EVs, defense, and cloud.</li>
<li><strong>Biotech</strong>: CRISPR therapies advancing rapidly; cholesterol trial is disruptive to legacy pharmaceuticals. Monitor major trial results for this and other gene-editing therapies.</li>
<li><strong>Renewables &amp; Utilities</strong>: US, EU lag on climate goals, but India ahead; slow transition favors nuclear and gas as bridge. Renewable buildout continues but sector allocation must account for policy volatility.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin and Ethereum</strong>: Positive momentum sustained but 2025 upside capped by &quot;risk-on&quot; equity flows and rate cut consensus. Sizable drawdowns remain possible if risk appetite sours or regulation accelerates. Bitcoin reserve buying by nation-states is not base case this year.</li>
<li><strong>Stablecoins</strong>: Regulatory risk remains nontrivial, but base-case is continued coexistence for now.</li>
<li><strong>Altcoins/DeFi</strong>: Launch volumes/high FDVs on new protocols (MetaMask, Consensys) signal continued appetite for alternatives, but likely to see high dispersion in performance as risk tolerance wanes into 2026.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global &amp; Emerging Markets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>China</strong>: Some recession risk, but no acute leadership challenge for Xi near-term. Tariff overhang and currency depreciation risk remains. Global supply chains may continue to diversify away from China.</li>
<li><strong>India/BRICS/EM</strong>: India is the climate goal outperformer. Status of BRICS expansion, potential EM trade deals, and currency moves (Argentina, Brazil, Turkey) are swing factors.</li>
<li><strong>Russia/Europe</strong>: Prolonged stalemate more likely than resolution. Germany, UK, Japan all face meaningfully elevated recession odds.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Special Situations &amp; Technicals</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Government Shutdown</strong>: With a deal in sight, expect a relief rally, particularly in travel, consumer, and defense names.</li>
<li><strong>Supply Chain</strong>: Chip supply/sanctions easing (China/Nexperia) is a positive, but tech decoupling and protectionism continue to drive second-order relocations in manufacturing and R&amp;D.</li>
<li><strong>Natural disasters</strong>: Philippines typhoon, ongoing seismic risk — monitoring catastrophic insurance losses and supply disruption for transitory impact.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Company Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia</strong>: Outperformance and market lead are expected to continue. AI, automotive partnerships, and resilient supply chain keep it in pole position.</li>
<li><strong>Apple</strong>: New satellite initiatives and product cycles (foldables, laptops, Vision Pro) underpin mixed sentiment. Leadership change not imminent.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla</strong>: Deliveries growing, but not at exponential rates; FSD/Optimist robots are longer-dated themes. CEO transition risk remains low.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft</strong>: Near-term upside probable as regulatory overhangs are not acute. Market structure and antitrust scrutiny should be watched for shifts in executive tone or outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Pharma/Biotech</strong>: CRISPR Therapeutics/DNA editing in cardiovascular risk—watch for spillover effect to other drugmakers.</li>
<li><strong>Banks (JPMorgan, GS, Citi, MS)</strong>: Executive turnover risk very low; most have stabilized funding costs since last year’s curve inversion and small bank stress.</li>
<li><strong>REITs</strong>: Regional office, LA/Chicago/multifamily remain under pressure; Houston, NYC show resilience. Expect regulatory push/pull on rent controls.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Actionable Ideas &amp; Watch List</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Risk-on sentiment prevails if shutdown ends and Fed cut narrative continues.</strong> Mega-cap growth, AI, semis, select biotech, and gold offer best exposure.</li>
<li><strong>Soft commodities, utilities, and insurers</strong>: monitor for transitory impacts (weather, drones, shutdown), but selectivity is warranted.</li>
<li><strong>Remain underweight Europe/Japan</strong>, as their recession risk is not fully priced. Watch for spillover via FX if US growth surprises to the downside.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto exposure</strong>: Remain disciplined; rise in altcoin launches could reverse fast if policy or macro risk returns.</li>
<li><strong>Interest rate sensitive sectors (REITs, homebuilders, small caps)</strong>: Bias to recovery, but watch for renewed fiscal/political shocks.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Stay alert for resolution of US government shutdown, legislative progress on AI/crypto/tariffs, and emerging headlines on Middle East tensions and natural disasters.</strong> Second- and third-order policy outcomes remain the hardest to price—expect volatility on any surprise fiscal/monetary shifts.</p>
