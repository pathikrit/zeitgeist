</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Market Outlook</h2>
<h3>US Economy &amp; Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Core inflation through early 2026 running solidly &gt;3%; next set of PCE/CPI data likely to keep Fed cautious but not trigger immediate tightening.</li>
<li>Odds still favor end-of-2025 soft landing (slowing but positive growth, unemployment creeping higher but not spiking). Market pricing aligns with two or three 25bp rate cuts in 2026 unless data surprises.</li>
<li>Sticky rents, insurance, and healthcare costs limit deflation potential—disinflation trade benefits longer duration, but any sign of re-acceleration will reset term premium upward.</li>
<li>Democrat polling advantage for 2026 House/ Senate could bolster fiscal spending, but repeated government funding fights remain a source of near-term market volatility.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonds, Rates, and USD</h3>
<ul>
<li>Term premium still sensitive to long-duration Treasury supply (Quarterly Refunding in February key) and US fiscal outlook.</li>
<li>10-Yr yield market-implied distribution is anchoring around the 3.8–4.3% range; risk of upside overshoot if Q4 inflation or fiscal shocks break trend.</li>
<li>USD stable/slightly bullish on relative growth; EUR/JPY and EM FX at risk if ECB/BoJ stall or China demand softens further.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Growth &amp; Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Risks of new escalation in Middle East (Israel–Lebanon, Israel–Iran) remain live; higher probability of cross-border strike than of negotiated de-escalation within year-end.</li>
<li>Ongoing US/China friction (including tech and EV trade) will drive sectoral performance (semis, autos) and could spill into currency and supply chain volatility if new tariffs are announced.</li>
<li>Ukraine conflict continues to grind—territorial changes/freeze-in-place or sudden regime change in Russia/Ukraine would drive short-term spikes in energy, defense, and risk-off flows (bonds/gold).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Themes</h2>
<h3>Technology / AI / Semis</h3>
<ul>
<li>US AI/semiconductor capex remains robust; Nvidia expected to post another record quarter, but any sign of a pause or margin pressure will drive sector-wide multiple contraction.</li>
<li>Antitrust headwinds for Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta remain but court resistance to breakups reduces near-term existential regulatory risk.</li>
<li>Large-scale AI IPOs (OpenAI, Anthropic likely before 2027) and token launches are vacuuming up speculative capital and creating short-term boosts in related semis, cloud infra, and venture-adjacent assets.</li>
<li>Elevated US–China tech export risk: any tightening in chip/hardware controls by year-end will have second-order effects for Asia tech, cloud providers, and downstream supply chain names.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Middle East escalation risk keeps crude well supported near term; OPEC+ remains price taker, not setter.</li>
<li>Large/mega caps in oil, defense, and regional infrastructure (shipping/insurance) are beneficiaries of even mild geopolitical premium.</li>
<li>Extreme weather (hurricane and typhoon season, persistent global heat records) supports insurance and ag-commodity (fertilizer, softs) volatility.</li>
<li>Macro commodity complex getting net support from strong DM growth; any turn in global PMIs—especially China/EM—would negatively swing sentiment sharply.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare/Biotech</h3>
<ul>
<li>US drug pricing risk remains structurally elevated into 2027 (especially if ACA reforms move); margin compression remains a concern for large-caps.</li>
<li>Low odds of major ACA repeal before 2027, but watch for signals on Medicare negotiating power expansion or SNAP benefit retrenchment.</li>
<li>Provider/insurer risk skewed to downside on fiscal instability and margin pressure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Estate &amp; Financials</h3>
<ul>
<li>Multifamily/office REITs remain under pressure from tech layoffs, soft rent growth in major coastal metros, and macro uncertainty; favorable in Sunbelt/energy-centric geographies.</li>
<li>Commercial mortgage issuers exposed to elevated refi risk as long-end yields remain sticky above 4%.</li>
<li>Financials (especially large-cap banks) modestly favored into Q1 2026 if curve steepens and credit remains resilient. High-yield exposure risk higher if recession odds pick up.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Recent airdrops/token launches are soaking up speculative capital, driving positive liquidity feedback into BTC/ETH/SOL. Near-term ETF flows still positive; further spot ETF opening in US/EU will be supportive.</li>
<li>Lawmakers' and regulators' attention shifting toward consumer protection and exchange transparency (Epstein/FTX fallout) but immediate market risk muted.</li>
<li>Ether and Solana remain risk-on plays with strong on-chain activity and stable DeFi/DEX demand. Regulatory risk for XRP remains non-trivial, but upside capped by ongoing litigation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Defense / Aerospace</h3>
<ul>
<li>Multi-year focus on defense contractors ($LMT, $RTX, $NOC, $GD, $BA) driven by Ukraine/Middle East escalation and durable bipartisan support for defense spending.</li>
<li>Aerospace (launch/space, e.g., SpaceX suppliers, Rocket Lab) benefits marginally from tech sector liquidity, but sector susceptible to single-event risk (launch failure, unexpected US government policy changes).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Retail &amp; Consumer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Earnings from Walmart, Target signal price competition and volume stabilization, but margin gains are harder to come by outside of automated/omnichannel leaders.</li>
<li>Any additional retail/fiscal stimulus (i.e., “tariff dividend” proposals) faces long odds of passage this year; consumer confidence improvement contingent on real wage growth and falling shelter/insurance costs.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Names / Event Risk</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>NVDA</strong>: AI cycle running hot but stock dependent on upside surprise; margin or guidance disappointment would reverberate throughout semis and AI infrastructure ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>AAPL/MSFT/GOOGL/AMZN/TSLA/META</strong>: All mega-caps in or near rotation; fade sectors with highest regulatory, margin, or AI hype exposure if yield curve turns up, GDP/inflation disappoint, or broad market rotates defensive.</li>
<li><strong>Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac</strong>: Odds of IPO within 12 months rising; market caps at issuance will telegraph appetite for government-backstop risk and influence MBS pricing.</li>
<li><strong>MSTR</strong>: Highly correlated to BTC spot flows and ETF launches; elevated risk/reward based on directional crypto volatility spikes.</li>
<li><strong>WMT/TGT/DELL/DE</strong>: Watch for guidance on automation/cost structure, labor costs, and margin commentary; negative commentary on labor costs or consumer credit would drive sector rotation into defensives.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Crypto (Short Horizon)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Macro liquidity, ETF inflows, and retail sentiment are all supportive. Multiple major token launches ($VOOI, $Stable, $Monad, $Zama, $Sentient) are acting as a liquidity magnet, driving positive feedback into leading chains/tokens (BTC, ETH, SOL).</li>
<li>Near-term ETF flows for BTC and ETH signal continued risk-on, but high volatility likely around key on-chain airdrop/launch events and headline regulatory moments.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitical &amp; Tail Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li>Elevated risk of new cross-border Middle East confrontation (Israel-Lebanon, Israel-Iran) before year-end; any event rout would drive immediate spike in energy, gold, defense contractors, and safe-haven currency/bonds.</li>
<li>Large non-zero probability of another major national security or natural disaster story (typhoon, hurricane, earthquake) with meaningful insurance and commodities impact through winter/spring.</li>
<li>Further escalation in US/China trade or tech restrictions remains a clear threat to global supply chain valuations and bullish US tech trade.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Upcoming Catalysts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nov 26-29</strong>: US PCE inflation (core, headline)—pricing in Dec/Jan rate-cut expectations, big for bonds, growth tech, real yields, USD.</li>
<li><strong>Dec 1-11</strong>: ISM PMIs, labor report (payrolls/unemployment), and CPI—set tone for 2026 rate path and cyclical/defensive sector rotation.</li>
<li><strong>Dec 17</strong>: FOMC meeting and projections—final dots/statement of year, high market sensitivity for growth, TIPS, Treasuries, and USD.</li>
<li><strong>Late Jan 2026</strong>: Q4 2025 GDP and first batch of mega-cap tech earnings; outlook and guidance will control direction of $SPY, $QQQ for Q1.</li>
<li><strong>Early Feb 2026</strong>: US Treasury Refunding Announcement—drives 10/30y supply, term premium, and long-duration asset preference.</li>
<li><strong>Q1 2026</strong>: US debt ceiling/government funding deadline—shutdown odds rising, volatility risk spikes in banks, defense, and risk-off assets.</li>
<li><strong>Spring–Summer 2026</strong>: SCOTUS term decisions—AI, antitrust, and health/pharma exposure could see large regulatory reset risk to tech, healthcare, and platform stocks.</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing</strong>: OPEC+ meetings (energy beta), major tech export/tariff decisions (semis/EVs), and large-scale AI IPO or crypto token launches.</li>
</ul>
