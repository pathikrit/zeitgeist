<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Cross-Asset Themes</h2>
<h3>US Economic Outlook</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Near-Term Recession:</strong> Very low probability of US recession in 2025. GDP growth projections for Q4 2025 are clustered around moderate expansion (1.5–2.5%), supporting risk assets for the near-term.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market:</strong> Unemployment rate expected to edge up above 4.2% heading into year-end, with additional pressure from tech sector layoffs. However, wage growth continues to outpace inflation, supporting consumer spending.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Most likely path for both headline and core inflation is in the 2.5–3.5% range for 2025. Food and energy prices (notably eggs, gasoline) show stickiness, with additional risk from supply shocks and tariffs.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rates:</strong> Federal Reserve rate hikes are almost off the table; three 25bp rate cuts look most probable in 2025. Major cuts beyond this pace remain unlikely barring an exogenous shock. The 10-year Treasury yield seen holding around 4–4.3%.</li>
<li><strong>US National Debt:</strong> Debt levels will push above $38 trillion by year-end, keeping fiscal concerns alive. No immediate risk of US default, but additional credit rating downgrades are possible.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trade Policy Uncertainty:</strong> Ongoing legal challenges to Trump’s global tariffs create significant uncertainty. If tariffs are struck down, expect rapid policy pivots with substantial second-order effects across manufacturing, autos, electronics, and trade-sensitive sectors.</li>
<li><strong>China &amp; Emerging Markets:</strong> No imminent risk of major China or Korea-related military escalation. Tensions remain elevated around Taiwan, but the near-term probability of disruption is low. Currency depreciation risk persists for MXN and BRL, but extreme moves are unlikely in the short window.</li>
<li><strong>Europe:</strong> Germany and UK face high risk of recession; Eurozone periphery remains vulnerable, though systemic crisis risk looks contained.</li>
<li><strong>Middle East:</strong> Gaza and Lebanon remain flashpoints. While a ground offensive or further escalation is possible, chances of spillover to broader energy markets (e.g., Strait of Hormuz closure) are low near-term.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Climate &amp; Natural Catastrophe</h3>
<ul>
<li>2025 expected to be among the hottest years recorded, with weather extremes and natural disasters trending up. Insurers may see elevated weather-related claims, and climate-responsive sectors (renewables, utilities, agri-commodities) could face volatility spikes.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Asset Class Views</h2>
<h3>Risk Assets/Equities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Broad US Indices:</strong> Conditions support constructive stance for risk assets: robust GDP, moderating inflation, easing rates. S&amp;P 500 is more likely to finish the year positive and could see upside continuation—tactical corrections possible around policy or macro headlines.</li>
<li><strong>Tech Sector:</strong> Leadership is shifting: Nvidia seen dominating as world’s largest company by market cap, reflecting continued AI optimism but also raising the bar for earnings delivery. Major tech names generally expected to trend higher through November; watch for Meta and Google earnings volatility and scrutiny of executive transitions.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer Staples &amp; Discretionary:</strong> Tight labor, inflation, and housing pressure persist, but real wage growth buffers consumer spending. Disruptions in SNAP benefits could stress low-end retail in Q4. Tariff-induced cost pressures remain a risk for major chains (Walmart, McDonald’s, Amazon).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commodities &amp; Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil:</strong> Near-term WTI oil rangebound ($59–75), with lower risk of an upside breakout. OPEC action and Middle East flashpoints can cause volatility, but sustained price spikes are unlikely.</li>
<li><strong>Gold:</strong> Strong momentum—expected to outperform Bitcoin. Price above $3,200 is anticipated, potentially continuing toward $4,000 if risk-off or inflation concerns mount.</li>
<li><strong>Renewables:</strong> US and global solar installation targets will drive continued capex and opportunity, but policy and supply chain headwinds persist.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Credit &amp; Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed Income:</strong> Gradual normalization in Fed policy—softening yields, but not a deep rally in long bonds. TIPS may underperform as inflation momentum cools.</li>
<li><strong>Mortgages &amp; Real Estate:</strong> 30-year mortgage rates to ease below 6% later in the year, but affordability/housing supply issues remain.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Alternatives / Crypto</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spot Bitcoin</strong> is volatile but supported above $90–100k in the near term; the risk of a sharp drawdown remains minor, but upside to $130–150k is capped for now. Gold looks more attractive as an inflation/reserve asset in 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto Legislation:</strong> Market structure reform has visible support but faces resistance for passage this year; larger tax changes unlikely. Institutional involvement (ETF flows, S&amp;P 500 company purchases) continues, if not at a sector-reshaping pace.</li>
<li><strong>Stablecoins:</strong> Market is stable for now; risk of large-scale depeg or regulatory crackdown is not imminent.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Key Individual Company Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia:</strong> Momentum leader. AI supply constraints (not enough power, not just chips) are a real bottleneck for future growth. Execution risk is rising as expectations set the bar extremely high.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla:</strong> Board likely to approve Elon Musk’s pay package. Unsupervised FSD seen on the horizon, but mass deployment still faces headwinds. No major M&amp;A moves expected. Production guidance attainable, but not outpacing global EV adoption rates.</li>
<li><strong>Apple:</strong> No near-term transformative product expected; stock trades with the sector but faces some underperformance risk as leadership focus and M&amp;A headlines surface.</li>
<li><strong>Meta, Google, Microsoft:</strong> AI competition intensifies; Google likely to hold pole position in AI benchmarks through year-end. Earnings volatility possible on new product announcements and evolving AI strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Walmart, McDonald’s:</strong> Both companies navigating rising wage, supply chain, and tariff costs. Consumer fundamentals are stable, but watch for policy developments affecting SNAP and low-income spending.</li>
<li><strong>Banks (JPMorgan):</strong> No signs of systemic financial distress in 2025; leadership questions (e.g., Dimon succession) aren’t market-moving right now.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Tactical Watch List</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monitor government shutdown duration—logistics/airline and some consumer sectors (especially travel) are most exposed.</li>
<li>Track Supreme Court decisions on tariffs—policy volatility risk for global supply chains and industrials.</li>
<li>Watch for labor data surprises; layoffs continuing in tech could affect sentiment, especially in the Nasdaq.</li>
<li>Weather risk (hurricanes, typhoons) affecting insurance, REITs, and agri-commodities.</li>
<li>New regulations or executive orders on AI, housing, or crypto could trigger volatility.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Near-term macro conditions remain supportive for risk assets, with tech and energy names in focus. Major geopolitical, policy, and natural disaster risks are present but do not pose systemic threats in the immediate window. Maintain diversity across risk, duration, and inflation-sensitive assets, with a close watch on US policy, rates, and supply-shock headlines.</p>
