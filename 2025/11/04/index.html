<h1>Daily Memo (04-Nov-2025)</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Key News Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Government Shutdown</strong>: The federal shutdown is on the brink of setting a new record, with bipartisan negotiations ongoing but limited optimism for an immediate deal. This is impacting government spending, SNAP benefits, and overall economic sentiment.</li>
<li><strong>US Elections</strong>: High-stakes mayoral and gubernatorial races are underway, with Trump’s policies and endorsements shaping narratives from New York to California and Virginia; corporate leaders signal wariness about progressive outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Supreme Court Tariff Case</strong>: The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a major case on Trump-era tariffs this week, determining executive tariff powers; the case has wide implications for trade, inflation, and corporate input costs.</li>
<li><strong>Middle East Instability</strong>: Israel is reeling from both internal scandals and ongoing military operations, with daily military interventions in Gaza and Lebanon and heightened global risk premium around regional security and oil supply.</li>
<li><strong>China/Netherlands Chip Dispute</strong>: China blames the Netherlands for a supply impasse involving Nexperia chips. China appears to have backed off some harsh restrictions, possibly easing global auto sector pressures.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate Activity</strong>: Starbucks exits China JV in a $4B deal, and Yum Brands is considering options for Pizza Hut. Both moves highlight the evolving consumer and competitive landscape, especially for multinationals.</li>
<li><strong>Climate &amp; Natural Disaster</strong>: Antarctic glaciers are retreating at unprecedented rates, driving up insurance and climate risk considerations for the energy/utilities/agriculture sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Tech/Crypto/Energy</strong>: Routine product launches and updates for Apple, and new AI/translate products for Google. Crypto/AI sentiment remains cautious, with market and regulatory uncertainty persisting.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Global Markets</h2>
<h3>US &amp; Global Macro</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recession Risk</strong>: The risk of a 2025 US recession is seen as quite low, but medium-term caution remains as unemployment is expected to drift higher. Government spending is likely to continue climbing, with deficit and debt setting new records.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rates &amp; Fed Policy</strong>: Markets anticipate the Federal Reserve to begin cutting rates within the coming months (most likely three cuts in 2025). There remains little expectation of rate hikes or emergency moves.
<ul>
<li>The 10-year Treasury yield is expected to remain above 4% for the near term.</li>
<li>No major central banks are expected to raise rates imminently; BOE may cut in 2025, and the ECB is likely to hold steady.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal / Political Risk</strong>: The government shutdown persists, with minor probability of imminent resolution. The federal budget and funding have become highly politicized, impacting consumer confidence and risk sentiment.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation</strong>: US inflation is sticking around 3%, and expectations are that it will linger above target—core inflation remains sticky as well. Wage growth may continue to outpace headline CPI, limiting the risk of stagflation but keeping the Fed cautious.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Foreign Exchange &amp; Trade</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>USD Strength</strong>: De-dollarization bets remain out of favor; the USD is expected to remain resilient in the short run with limited risks of major de-peg events among stablecoins.</li>
<li><strong>Global Trade Tension</strong>: New US tariffs on China, India, Canada, Mexico, Korea, and Taiwan are considered likely, with potential trade deals scarce and reciprocal tariffs from the EU/China probable.
<ul>
<li>US tariff policy is expected to drive up import costs, create profit margin strains for global manufacturers, and trigger potential shifts in supply chains (further nearshoring/friendshoring).</li>
<li>Tariff-related cases are landing in the Supreme Court; judicial outcomes could cause volatility in multinational and industrial names.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Middle East</strong>: Continued Israeli military actions in Gaza and Lebanon are almost certain, with risk of escalation involving Iran or energy infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Russia/Ukraine</strong>: Fighting continues, with some territorial gains for Russia expected in the near-term. Ceasefire or diplomatic resolutions remain elusive.</li>
<li><strong>China Risk</strong>: No imminent personnel change for Xi Jinping; focus is on semiconductors and supply chain resilience due to ongoing US-China tensions.</li>
<li><strong>Emerging Markets</strong>: Evolving political risk (elections, possible protests) in Latin America and Africa may impact energy and commodity exposure.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Asset Allocation</h2>
<h3>Equities &amp; Index Outlook</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Large Cap</strong>: S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ expected to finish the year in positive territory, but the risk of corrections or temporary drawdowns remains, especially with higher-for-longer rates and modest earnings growth.</li>
<li><strong>Sector Rotation</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Tech</strong>: AI remains the dominant theme, but tech layoffs are up and the sector faces margin compression (input costs, wage growth).</li>
<li><strong>Energy</strong>: Oil and gas prices are expected to remain rangebound with downside risk, but geopolitical disruptions could cause spikes.</li>
<li><strong>Industrials/Manufacturing</strong>: Tariffs and supply chain reconfiguration are significant headwinds. Companies most reliant on foreign components or demand may struggle.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer</strong>: Inflation and policy uncertainty (e.g., SNAP benefit disruptions) could depress discretionary spending, especially among lower-income consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Financials</strong>: Stable but watching for potential credit events should the downturn in employment or real estate intensify.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare</strong>: Biotech and pharma face regulatory/tariff risk and political volatility, especially around drug pricing and vaccine policy.</li>
<li><strong>Real Estate/REITs</strong>: Higher unemployment/tax migration policies present persistent risks to commercial/residential REITs, particularly in NYC/California.</li>
<li><strong>Defense</strong>: Elevated global tensions and ongoing conflict support the sector.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gold</strong>: Outperformance over crypto is expected by year-end. Gold is likely to benefit from ongoing macro/political risk and sticky inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto</strong>: Downside volatility remains a concern for major names (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana) in the near-term. Stablecoin depeg/systemic risk events are low probability but remain a tail risk.</li>
<li><strong>Energy &amp; Commodities</strong>: Oil is expected to remain below $75 in Texas and below $4.50 in California; OPEC supply decisions and geopolitical shocks are wildcards. Natural gas prices are also skewed lower barring cold weather spikes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixed Income</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rates</strong>: The risk-free rate environment is anticipated to remain restrictive, with only gradual easing. Long-duration bonds and TIPS less attractive unless growth/inflation deteriorates sharply.</li>
<li><strong>Munis</strong>: Federal policy risk to the traditional tax exemption is low, but fiscal distress in cities/states (migration, budget actions) could still hit selected issuers.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company/Name-Specific Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>NVIDIA</strong>: Remains positioned to be the largest company by market cap throughout 2025. AI, hyperscalers, and geopolitical chip supply are persistent themes. Tariff and US/China exposure remain secondary risks.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla</strong>: Margins and deliveries are likely to track global EV adoption, which is solid but maturing. Regulatory risk on FSD timelines remains. Musk’s pay package expected to pass; company is not expected to be the world’s largest by market cap soon.</li>
<li><strong>Apple, Google/Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta</strong>: Little expectation of CEO turnover in 2025. Product innovation (AI, hardware upgrades) remains a draw, but regulatory and valuation risks linger as anti-monopoly suits and policy scrutiny ramp up.</li>
<li><strong>Starbucks/Yum Brands</strong>: Disinvestment/activity in China draws attention to multinational risk and changing consumer dynamics there.</li>
<li><strong>Walmart, McDonald's</strong>: Facing pressure from tariffs, input costs, and shifting US consumption patterns; supply chain and SNAP policy disruptions could impact near-term results.</li>
<li><strong>Pharma</strong>: Drug price controls and regulatory actions (Ozempic, insulin, vaccine approvals/withdrawals) create earnings and headline risk.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto-Related Equities</strong>: Volatility in underlying assets (BTC, ETH, etc.) and regulatory overhang weigh on Coinbase, MicroStrategy, Robinhood, etc.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Actionable Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintain diversified exposures</strong> across US equities, with a tilt toward sectors resilient to higher inflation (commodities, gold, defense, utilities) and those that benefit from long-term AI/tech R&amp;D, but be wary of earnings headline risks.</li>
<li><strong>Hedge interest rate exposure</strong>. Favor short-to-intermediate maturities in fixed income unless signs of a sharp downturn emerge.</li>
<li><strong>Reduce overweight</strong> China/global supply chain reliant companies until tensions around tariffs/export controls break one way or the other.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor SNAP &amp; fiscal headlines</strong>; disruptions here could reduce lower-end consumer spending and spike volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Prepare for tactical volatility</strong> as the government shutdown, Supreme Court trade cases, and global conflict events play out, especially in sectors and ETFs sensitive to newsflow.</li>
<li><strong>Revisit alternative allocations</strong>: Gold’s risk/reward and inflation protection look more favorable than crypto for the next quarter. Crypto volatility is persistently high with downside risk from regulation and ETF flows.</li>
<li><strong>Watch for regulatory headlines</strong> in healthcare/pharma, tech antitrust, and municipal bond policy, which could create abrupt sector rotation or sentiment shifts.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong><br />
Central bank and government policy remain the key drivers for asset class returns, but political and supply chain volatility, combined with sticky inflation and climbing unemployment, keep risk premia elevated across sectors. As portfolio construction becomes more news- and event-driven, tactical rebalancing and vigilant risk management are vital. Stay alert to rapid changes in unemployment trends, global escalation, and tariff litigation this week.</p>
