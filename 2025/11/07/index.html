<h1>Daily Memo (07-Nov-2025)</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Key News Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Government Shutdown</strong>: The US federal government remains shut down for a record length. Senate votes and political infighting suggest an extended shutdown, with significant market and social services impacts (SNAP benefits ordered released by court).</li>
<li><strong>Global Geopolitics</strong>: Israeli military activity continues in Gaza and Lebanon; high likelihood of further strikes and no imminent ceasefire. US strikes on drug boats highlight rising security operations in Latin America.</li>
<li><strong>China/Asia</strong>: China commissions a new aircraft carrier, signaling military ambition. Tech valuations and trade disputes weigh on Asian equities.</li>
<li><strong>US Domestic Politics</strong>: Democratic Party faces internal disputes amid electoral wins. Pelosi’s retirement signals leadership transition.</li>
<li><strong>Tech and AI</strong>: Global sell-off in tech equities linked to AI bubble caution. Major US AI and semiconductor firms face renewed scrutiny, ongoing trade/tariff risk, and valuation pressures.</li>
<li><strong>Health and Risk</strong>: Public health news includes rising measles cases and study warnings on melatonin and heavy alcohol use. Rabid bat incidents are up in Southern California.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro Themes</h2>
<h3>US Macroeconomics &amp; Markets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soft Landing Expected</strong>: The economic consensus suggests the US is on a soft landing trajectory for 2025. Recession risk remains modest short-term, but increases significantly post-2026.</li>
<li><strong>Rate Cuts Likely</strong>: Several Fed rate cuts are widely anticipated for 2025, though the exact number and pacing are unclear. Consensus is for multiple but not extreme cuts; an emergency cut or hikes are unlikely unless triggered by a shock (shutdown, surprise inflation, financial crisis).</li>
<li><strong>Inflation</strong>: Core and headline CPI expected elevated but controlled, mostly in the 2.5%-3.5% range for 2025. Key upside risk stems from tariffs, energy disruptions, and policy shocks.</li>
<li><strong>Government Dysfunction</strong>: Prolonged government shutdown is already affecting services, data reporting, and markets. Delayed fiscal resolution and social safety net strains could add to volatility.</li>
<li><strong>National Debt, Credit Ratings</strong>: US debt continues to climb past $38T, with additional downgrades seen as plausible before 2027. Bond yields remain high, likely above 4% for 10Y.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Macro/Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hot Global Conflict</strong>: The Middle East (Israel-Gaza-Lebanon), Russia-Ukraine, and new rounds of US-LatAm security actions create ongoing geopolitical risk. No near-term peace in Ukraine or end to Israeli offensives is anticipated, and oil remains at risk from escalation.</li>
<li><strong>China-West Tensions</strong>: US-China and broader US-allies trade friction remains high, with tariffs entrenched and little progress expected. China's military build-up and leadership succession rumors will maintain uncertainty for multinationals.</li>
<li><strong>Climate/Energy</strong>: The world is on track to breach 2C warming before 2050. Short-term (2025) will likely see extreme weather disrupt commodities and insurance, with slow renewable progress outside China/India. Oil, gas, and coal remain critical globally.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Viewpoints</h2>
<h3>Equities &amp; Sectors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tech &amp; AI</strong>
<ul>
<li>Valuations are under pressure from AI bubble concerns. Large cap AI/semis (NVIDIA, Google, Microsoft) still dominate, but are acutely sensitive to US-China/Asia tariffs and regulatory noise.</li>
<li>Multiple new US and EU tech antitrust cases are likely; Big Tech faces both market and policy headwinds.</li>
<li>Large upcoming IPO (OpenAI, Klarna, etc.) window appears pushed into late 2026 or beyond for most unicorns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Defense &amp; Industrials</strong>
<ul>
<li>Defense stocks benefit from global military build-outs and new US security operations. Watch for supply chain/tariff headwinds, but secular demand strong.</li>
<li>US/EU and China ramp up production and procurement (see China’s new carrier).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Energy &amp; Commodities</strong>
<ul>
<li>Short-term oil price volatility tied to geopolitics (Middle East, Russia-Ukraine). No structural supply/demand resolution.</li>
<li>Despite long-term decarbonization, oil, gas, coal, and nuclear remain vital (renewables not supplanting legacy sources in next several years).</li>
<li>Infrastructure and reinsurance face ongoing natural disaster and climate risks. Extreme weather events more likely, impacting ag/commodities and insurance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Financials</strong>
<ul>
<li>Few systemically important bank failures expected, but stress in some smaller or alternative lenders is possible if shutdown and credit strains persist.</li>
<li>Private credit and PE managers (KKR, Franklin Resources) remain relatively robust; no broad financial contagion seen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare &amp; Biopharma</strong>
<ul>
<li>Price pressure for major drugs (Ozempic, insulin) to persist, but no smoking-gun regulatory shock indicated in near term.</li>
<li>Psychedelic approvals are possible but not imminent enough to shift sector allocation rapidly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Real Estate</strong>
<ul>
<li>Large rent increases continue in major US metros. Underlying demand is steady, but mortgage rates stubbornly high. Risks are elevated in event of macro or policy shock.</li>
<li>Natural disaster and shutdown risks weigh on REITs and MBS, but not forecasting an immediate crisis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</strong>
<ul>
<li>Volatility stays high but near-term tail risk is subdued. Regulatory risk is persistent but not existential in 2025.</li>
<li>Stablecoins appear robust; no major depeg event foreseen.</li>
<li>Bitcoin and Ethereum has limited additional upside in 2025, underperforming gold this year.</li>
<li>Corporate and sovereign adoption will continue at a slow pace.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Commodities &amp; Gold</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gold continues to serve as inflation/volatility hedge, with strong returns expected this year amid policy and growth uncertainty.</li>
<li>Commodities risk is skewed to the upside if new conflict or supply chain shocks hit energy assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company-Specific Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>NVIDIA, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon (Mega-Caps)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Expect recurring headline/valuation pressure from antitrust/tariff stories, but earnings power is resilient absent a deep macro shock.</li>
<li>Google expected to maintain AI model leadership through at least December.</li>
<li>No major leadership departures forecast.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tesla</strong>
<ul>
<li>CEO remains secure. Unsupervised FSD launch is possible by mid-2026, but headline volatility around legal and product announcements may be high.</li>
<li>Industry headwinds in EV demand growth and delivery ramp, but not an existential challenge.</li>
<li>Musk’s pay package approved; no board disruption expected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Paramount, Warner Bros., Comcast, Amazon</strong>
<ul>
<li>M&amp;A in media expected to continue; highest probability is for Paramount to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Disney, Netflix</strong>
<ul>
<li>Disney faces subscriber, debt, and acquisitions themes in earnings. Netflix’s pricing power looks intact.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI, Klarna, Stripe, others (IPOs)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Unlikely to see most large tech IPOs before mid/late 2026. Private funding/liquidity remains abundant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Banking</strong>
<ul>
<li>No expected major US bank bailouts near term; lesser players may face balance sheet stress if credit worsens.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Second Order Effects &amp; Themes To Monitor</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shutdown-Driven Delays</strong>: As the government shutdown drags on, expect reporting gaps, data drought (BLS jobs, CPI), benefits delays, and potential downward revisions to policy and growth forecasts. This may increase volatility in rates, equities, and credit over several weeks/months.</li>
<li><strong>Tariff &amp; Trade War</strong>: Enduring and spreading tariffs (US/EU/Asia) may cause cost-push inflation and cap margin upside for global manufacturers, tech, and consumer firms. Supply chain adaptation is slow; earnings risk rises in global sectors most reliant on Asia.</li>
<li><strong>AI and Big Tech Regulation</strong>: Momentum for AI regulation and antitrust action is rising in the US and EU. Fines and operational constraints are possible, but outright breakups or forced sales (Meta/Instagram) unlikely short-term.</li>
<li><strong>Climate Event Risk</strong>: Natural disasters, extreme heat, and insurance losses pose ongoing tail risk to ag, utilities, and property/casualty names. Real estate and insurers may underperform in affected regions.</li>
<li><strong>2025-2026 Political Uncertainty</strong>: Elevated policy risk around midterms, shutdown, Fed leadership changes, and global elections. Large swings in tax rates, entitlements, or regulatory scope are unlikely in the next year, but political tail risk could quickly emerge.</li>
<li><strong>Commodities/Resource Volatility</strong>: Energy and ag remain vulnerable to supply disruptions from hot conflict (Middle East, Russia-Ukraine), climate, or sanctions.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Key Watchpoints</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resolution timing of US government shutdown</strong> and fiscal negotiations.</li>
<li><strong>Path of Fed rate cuts</strong> post-shutdown; closely track macro data releases when/if they resume.</li>
<li><strong>Escalation/de-escalation in Middle East and Russia-Ukraine conflicts</strong> impacting energy, currency, and defense pricing.</li>
<li><strong>Tech sector sentiment</strong> on further AI run-up or rotation out of crowded mega-cap positions.</li>
<li><strong>Major IPO, M&amp;A or antitrust activity</strong> (especially among tech/AI/retail/media).</li>
<li><strong>Insurance, utilities, and REITs sensitivity</strong> to climate/natural disaster event flow.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Overall Positioning</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>US equities on solid footing but vulnerable to policy, rate, and headline swings.</li>
<li>Value and defensive sectors (gold, energy, consumer staples, insurance) continue to play a risk-mitigating role.</li>
<li>Maintain underweight in sectors tied to government payments, overlevered financials, and real estate most exposed to regional or disaster risks.</li>
<li>AI/semiconductor and defense players retain secular long-term demand even amid regulatory hurdles; expect near-term volatility but no secular unwind.</li>
<li>Continue caution in global exporters and firms most exposed to new tariffs.</li>
</ul>
