<li><strong>GOP/Trump/Mamdani:</strong> Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene resigns from Congress after public disputes and a break with Trump; Trump and left-wing NY Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani meet cordially, indicating possible shifting cross-aisle realignment on discrete economic issues.</li>
<li><strong>Middle East/Israel:</strong> No significant progress on a Gaza ceasefire; regional risk persists with ongoing Israeli military actions and deadlock at the COP climate talks.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Key Macro and Market Developments</h2>
<h3>Macro/Policy</h3>
<p><strong>U.S. Macro:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recession risk remains low for 2025 but rises meaningfully into 2026, per market pricing and macro data.</li>
<li>Inflation—November CPI and PCE are critical; market is pricing above-3% YoY as base case into Q1 2026, tail-risk remains of a sticky or re-accelerating print.</li>
<li>Fed—Odds moving to a March 2026 cut, but persistent core inflation or strong jobs could delay; market is already pricing in &gt;2 rate cuts for 2026 but with wide uncertainty on pace.</li>
<li>National debt to continue record trajectory; supply overhang from Treasury will keep the long end volatile.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fiscal/Shock Risk:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. government shutdown risk has revived for early 2026. Repricing risk for defense, healthcare, and contractors if negotiations turn acrimonious.</li>
<li>Tax, tariff, and fiscal policy debates and 2026 expiration of multiple provisions will dominate sector positioning in Q1-Q2.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>China/Japan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>JPY stability at the margin as BoJ holds for now; elevated risk of snap Japanese election in 12–18 month window.</li>
<li>U.S.–China summit outcomes inconclusive; continued risk of new tech and trade restrictions. Japan–China spat on Taiwan at UN is an early warning of Asia ex-China supply chain rerouting acceleration for multinationals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Climate/Energy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Deadlock at COP talks signals no rapid global decarbonization breakthrough; risk is for higher-for-longer fossil demand and input volatility.</li>
<li>OPEC+ upcoming quota changes are salient—oil near $75/bbl is a policy focus; upside risk to energy equities and CPI if cuts are coordinated.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Sector Themes</h3>
<p><strong>AI and Big Tech:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>AI infra (NVDA, MSFT, cloud) is supported by competitive model developments; customer retrenchment or regulatory shock (bankruptcy or antitrust suit against OpenAI/Mistral/Anthropic) poses tail risk to hyperscalers, AI semiconductor multiples.</li>
<li>Google’s Gemini dominating model benchmarks, but ads in AI search threaten margins in core business if cannibalization outpaces traffic gains.</li>
<li>Leadership risk in AI startups: Inevitable churn/disclosure could prompt delayed IPOs, market cap deflation, or &quot;winner-takes-most&quot; consolidation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consumer/Travel/Leisure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Thanksgiving/holiday travel: TSA volumes tracking toward upper end, supporting airlines/resort advertising and short-term leisure/consumer flows.</li>
<li>Large retailers (WMT, BBY): Stable to strong Black Friday demand signals; any PCE surprise could change duration and factor exposure sharply.</li>
<li>Streaming/media solid as NFLX dominates global platform engagement. Box office outperformance by big tentpoles (&quot;Wicked: For Good,&quot; strong previews, etc.) will help Disney/Comcast into next quarter's results.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Industrials/Commodities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Auto production/sales moderate but stable; early read-throughs on capex discipline from Ford, GM affecting supply chain (TSLA, Lucid, Rivian bankruptcy risk on rise).</li>
<li>Input cost uncertainty for food/ag (Tyson’s Nebraska beef plant closure) and fertilizer; raises inflation risk for Q1 2026 CPI basket via food.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Energy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>OPEC+ action and policy volatility remain—positioning favors balanced but optionality to a rally if production is cut further.</li>
<li>Defensive setup preferred in U.S. energy sector as oil remains attached to upside tail geopolitical risk.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Healthcare/Biotech:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>GLP-1-driven outperformance continues (Lilly joins $1T club); but regulatory and pricing risks on horizon for 2026 scenarios.</li>
<li>More drug approvals than historical mean; PIPE and M&amp;A markets heating up for early-stage biotech.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Financials:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Banks showing stable credit quality so far, but Q4 results likely to challenge ‘soft landing’ narrative if labor rolls over; fiscal/policy shocks (Treasury supply, shutdown risk) could reprice curve and NIM for regionals.</li>
<li>Margin stress risk acute for select consumer finance and proptech (OPEN, ABNB watching housing volume) as mortgage rates remain elevated, but first signs of rate relief in 2026 could become new factor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crypto:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tactical bottoming signals (Greed &amp; Fear) in BTC/ETH/SOL—positioning favored to risk-on for spot and ETF inflows, but structural tail risk remains through stablecoin market structure (Tether, USDC, DAI) and regulatory events.</li>
<li>Token launch/airdrop activity accelerating (Monad, MegaETH, Zama, Lighter, etc.)—providing liquidity, but market susceptible to overextension and &quot;airdrop rotation&quot; selloffs.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Individual Names/Key Moves</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>NVDA:</strong> Volatility driven by market-cap rotation. Leadership in AI hardware is intact but exposure to regulatory/antitrust and cyclical AI infra spend risk is elevated.</li>
<li><strong>AAPL/GOOGL/MSFT/AMZN/META:</strong> Market cap-leadership and sector rotation remain in flux as Q4 approaches. Model-driven risk in AI and privacy regulations are the clearest threats to margin and ad revenue.</li>
<li><strong>TSLA:</strong> Product pipeline steady; risk increases around bankruptcy probabilities for Lucid; Robo-taxi and FSD timelines now likely to slip further given low probability for regulatory approval before 2027.</li>
<li><strong>PLTR:</strong> AI/defense positioning remains favored, but court-driven contract risk remains for 2026 and beyond.</li>
<li><strong>COIN/Exchanges:</strong> Crypto ETF news and airdrop events power flows; exchange tokens and IPO rumor-mill provide breadth but also volatility risk.</li>
<li><strong>Banks/Financials:</strong> Leadership churn possible at JPM (probability of Dimon exit &gt;50% before 2027); sector will be bid up for earnings quality and capital return—especially as credit event probability increases.</li>
<li><strong>BYND, WKHS, IRBT, C3AI:</strong> Bankruptcy bets rise—short bias. Market expects only one or two to survive intact through 2026.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Upcoming Catalysts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nov U.S. PCE inflation (Nov 28):</strong> Key for rate-cut path, growth/tech multiple risk.</li>
<li><strong>OPEC+ policy meeting (early December):</strong> Crude quota outcome may reprice energy, commodities, and CPI path.</li>
<li><strong>December FOMC (Dec 17):</strong> Rate cut timing, dot plot, and QT guidance—next curve and risk-repricing inflection.</li>
<li><strong>December jobs/CPI cluster (Dec 5–11):</strong> Directional on growth vs. stagflation debate, impacts duration and credit trades.</li>
<li><strong>Government shutdown risk (Jan 2026):</strong> Market volatility spillover, especially to defense, healthcare, and Treasuries.</li>
<li><strong>Q4 earnings season (mid-Jan 2026 start):</strong> Margins/capex guidance for tech/financials/industrials shape Q1 rotation.</li>
<li><strong>January/Feb 2026 ECB/BoE meetings:</strong> FX, duration, and global money flow impacts from policy divergence.</li>
<li><strong>Major U.S.-China diplomatic engagement (3-6mo):</strong> Tariff/export control changes could impact tech/supply-chain risk premia.</li>
<li><strong>U.S. Supreme Court decisions (by June 2026):</strong> Reg risk across energy, tech, financials, and new regulatory frameworks.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal/tax policy negotiations (thru 2026):</strong> Corporate tax, clean-energy incentive extensions, defense spend set broad sector tone.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto ETF, stablecoin, and regulatory actions (next 3-9mo):</strong> BTC, ETH, broader crypto, and correlated risk assets directly exposed to U.S. rulemaking cadence.</li>
</ul>
