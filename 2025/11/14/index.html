<h1>Daily Memo (14-Nov-2025)</h1>
<h2>Key News Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Politics</strong>: Trump addresses Epstein allegations, persists in campaign and governing priorities. Shutdown averted, but Senate-GOP infighting over shutdown deal measures.</li>
<li><strong>Legal/Political Risks</strong>: New prosecutor assigned in Georgia election case. Marjorie Taylor Greene pushes for release of Epstein files, Republican disunity grows.</li>
<li><strong>Fed &amp; Markets</strong>: Hawkish commentary and economic data undercut immediate rate cut hopes; equities volatile, especially in tech. FOMC, CPI (11-Dec), NFP (6-Dec), and US debt funding deadlines are on deck.</li>
<li><strong>Energy &amp; Geopolitics</strong>: Iran seized a tanker post-Hormuz passage; OPEC+ meeting (30-Nov) could impact oil markets. Russia increases attacks on Kyiv; violence escalates in Israel/West Bank.</li>
<li><strong>Climate &amp; US West</strong>: SoCal faces flooding/mudslide threat from a potent storm; simultaneous wildfires complicate CA risk profiles (evacuations under way).</li>
<li><strong>Retail/Consumer</strong>: Walmart CEO transition announced (Furner replacing McMillon in January); Target and Walmart earnings to feature automation, tariffs, SNAP.</li>
<li><strong>International</strong>: Swiss-US deal: tariffs on Swiss goods cut to 15% for massive US investment. Chinese astronauts return after debris-delayed mission.</li>
<li><strong>AI/Tech</strong>: AI remains a market and earnings focus—Google's Gemini 3.0 release imminent, Nvidia's guidance/AI exposure vital (next earnings Q1 2026).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Rates</h2>
<h3>Inflation, Fed &amp; Employment</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fed Rate Path</strong>: Markets have reduced probability of imminent rate cuts following recent Fedspeak and stable inflation prints. December FOMC seen as likely pause but with generally dovish expectations into 2026; three cuts in 2025 remain consensus, though timing/pace could move with data.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation</strong>: CPI prints suggest headline and core will remain in the 2.9-3.2% YoY window for the coming months. November CPI (11-Dec) is a critical test; further cooling implies 2026 rate cuts/softer USD.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market</strong>: Soft-landing thesis is holding; yet, consumer-linked retailers (WMT, TGT) emphasize SNAP, holiday and automation to shape spending and margin narratives. Unemployment risk remains skewed towards gradual rise, not spike.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal Policy &amp; US Debt</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Government Funding</strong>: Extension passed, but shutdown/budget gridlock risk remains into December. Another shutdown event before year end is possible, affecting sentiment and rates.</li>
<li><strong>Deficit &amp; Treasuries</strong>: Aversion to long-dated US debt persists with auctions requiring higher yields; large 10Y auction coming in February's refunding cycle. Macro/fiscal backdrop supports higher long-term rates even if the Fed eases later in 2026.</li>
</ul>
<h3>International Central Banks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>ECB/BOE</strong>: ECB and BoE both expected to pause or cut in December policy meetings. EUR and GBP likely to remain under pressure vs USD as central bank tone signals.</li>
<li><strong>BOJ (JPY)</strong>: No sudden YCC shift expected in December, but JGB-UST spreads remain critical for global bond risk.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitics &amp; Energy</h2>
<h3>Middle East Risks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Israel/West Bank</strong>: Settler violence and mosque arson raise regional tension. Odds of broader escalation to Lebanon or Iran remain non-negligible through year-end, especially with OPEC+ and Strait of Hormuz tensions (Iran tanker seizure).</li>
<li><strong>Oil Market</strong>: OPEC+ Nov 30 meeting likely to preserve restrictive stance unless recession risk increases. Oil currently ranges mid-60s to high-70s into year-end.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Russia/Ukraine</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Military &amp; Civilian Impact</strong>: Russia ramps up Kyiv strikes; winter could bring infrastructure disruptions. EU debates aid and risk, but no sign of negotiations. Ukraine strikes into Russia or on energy assets would swing commodities further.</li>
</ul>
<h3>China</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taiwan Risk</strong>: Near-term Taiwan tensions stable but broader risk of military clash remains elevated into 2026; US-China diplomatic engagement remains limited.</li>
<li><strong>US-China Trade</strong>: Select US tariff rollbacks (cf. Switzerland) signal tactical deals are possible elsewhere, but large-scale easing unlikely near term.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Thematic Insights</h2>
<h3>Tech/AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Model Race</strong>: Google's Gemini 3 launch approaches (likely in coming weeks), dominating narrative; Nvidia remains cornerstone for sector leadership and supply chain profits. Microsoft/Meta/Alphabet continue to face regulatory and AI model competition scrutiny.</li>
<li><strong>IPO/M&amp;A</strong>: Stripe, OpenAI, and Discord IPOs are possible 2026 (as opposed to near-term), supporting medium-term US tech capital markets (but near-term supply remains light).</li>
<li><strong>Supply Chain &amp; Tariffs</strong>: High odds of tariffs on auto/semiconductor supply chains in 2025; Switzerland deal is idiosyncratic, but marginally supportive for capital goods/industrial equities with EU exposure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Retail/Consumer</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Holiday Spending</strong>: Retailers emphasizing competitive pricing, loyalty (SNAP), and inventory management driving near-term commentary—automation and brick-and-mortar traffic under scrutiny. CEO turnover at Walmart increases strategic uncertainty for 2026.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Volatility</strong>: Union strikes (e.g., Starbucks) and minimum wage activism in cities like Seattle could spread. Watch labor cost pressure effects on S&amp;P retail and hospitality chains.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Drillers &amp; Renewables</strong>: No significant upward move in rig counts or solar installs. Clean energy IP and nuclear progress are slow, with niche licensing expected, not widespread reactor rollout. Wildfire/weather disruptions in CA should be watched for insurance and utility sector strains.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Banks</strong>: Elevated bankruptcy risk continues to loom (esp. in CRE); next Q4 earnings (Jan–Feb) key for NII/credit risk clarification. IPO/fintech window cautiously reopening, but Fintech IPOs (Stripe etc) are more 2026 catalysts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Estate &amp; REITs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>CA/Western RE Risk</strong>: Flood, mudslide, and fire events in CA raise reinsurance costs and CRE stress; state tax regime debates could also move large investor and REIT capital allocations.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Major Catalyst Timeline</h2>
<p><strong>Upcoming:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dec 6: US NFP / unemployment (Nov)</li>
<li>Dec 11: US CPI (Nov) &amp; ECB decision</li>
<li>Dec 17: FOMC meeting</li>
<li>Dec 20: US government funding/debt ceiling critical (shutdown risk)</li>
<li>Dec 20: Core PCE inflation (Nov)</li>
<li>Jan 29: US Q4 GDP (advanced)</li>
<li>Late Jan–mid Feb: Major US tech/growth earnings</li>
<li>Feb 5: Quarterly Treasury Refund, auction size reset (duration mix)</li>
<li>Nov 30: OPEC+ meeting (oil policy)</li>
<li>Ongoing: Israel-Hamas/West Bank, Russia-Ukraine, Strait of Hormuz events (headline/commodity risk)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Positioning Implications</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Macro</strong>: Stay underweight duration until post-FOMC/December data resolves trend in yields; TIPS only selectively for lingering inflation upside.</li>
<li><strong>Equities</strong>: Bias to large cap US quality/tech versus European/Asian cyclicals; US small-caps still lag following rate headwinds.</li>
<li><strong>Energy</strong>: Lean neutral on oil, but keep flexibility for tactical trades around OPEC+ and MENA shock events (oil/defense uptick risk still latent).</li>
<li><strong>Tech/AI</strong>: NVDA, MSFT, and GOOGL remain pivotal ahead of earnings; AI hardware and model leadership likely to drive sector rotations.</li>
<li><strong>REITs/CRE</strong>: Caution in California, especially post-disaster and if state wealth tax moves forward; watch mortgage and agency REITs around funding/policy deadlines.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto</strong>: Crypto market structure stable, BTC/ETH tracking ETF/adoption flows; upside catalysts depend on new sovereign buying and regulatory advances in 2026.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Second/Third-Order Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sudden fiscal standoffs or debt ceiling fights near December 20 could spark sharp moves in yields and volatility; risk-off bias warranted around headline risk windows.</li>
<li>Mideast/Ukraine escalation remains a tail-risk for oil (spurts above $75) and broad volatility, especially as cold weather/flood conditions hamper logistics globally.</li>
<li>Tech CEO/leadership shifts (Walmart, others potentially) could create buying or selling pressure in associated supply chain/partner names.</li>
<li>Large catastrophic events in California could propagate into regional reinsurance and MBS/pricing risk across US securitized products, hitting broader market beta.</li>
<li>Continued labor unrest may accelerate cost-push inflation in services/retail, prolonging wage/inflation debate.</li>
<li>Geopolitical tail events—e.g., Iran closing Hormuz, China-Taiwan moves—remain underpriced but significant should they develop (orderly hedging through energy/defense/gold holds merit).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Macro: Fed to hold/pause; major December data and policy events will drive market direction into 2026. Government funding, CPI, and FOMC outcomes are the near-term swing variables.</li>
<li>Sector: AI/Tech outperformance persists, but rate-sensitive and consumer/retail sectors choppy into year-end. Watch further retail earnings, tech/AI catalyst flow, and year-end credit trends for actionable position shifts.</li>
<li>Geopolitics: Mideast, Russia/Ukraine, and Asia-Pacific tail risks provide upside volatility for defense, commodities, USD, and volatility hedges.</li>
<li>Catalysts: December/January are loaded with macro event risk and corporate reporting—adjust exposures for policy, fiscal, and exogenous shock risk, especially in energy and rates.</li>
