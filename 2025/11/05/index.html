<h1>Daily Memo (05-Nov-2025)</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Key News Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Government Shutdown</strong> is ongoing, entering one of the longest stretches on record with no swift resolution in sight; SNAP food aid delays are sparking both political and market anxiety.</li>
<li><strong>Trump’s Tariffs</strong> are in the Supreme Court spotlight as a “life or death” case, with significant implications for trade and corporate profitability.</li>
<li><strong>US Airspace Closure Fears</strong>: DOT signals some air routes may close due to air traffic controller shortages linked to the shutdown, weighing on airlines.</li>
<li><strong>Apple</strong> is reportedly close to launching a low-cost MacBook and continues software innovation; strong iPhone/OS upgrade cycle persists.</li>
<li><strong>Palantir</strong> plunges after earnings on valuation concerns despite continued expansion in AI/data analytics.</li>
<li><strong>AMD and Rivian</strong> post strong quarterly reports, indicating robust tech hardware and EV sector demand.</li>
<li><strong>Typhoon Kalmaegi</strong> devastates the Philippines, highlighting climate-related risk and insurance sector exposures.</li>
<li>International violence and instability continue (e.g., hostage remains handed over in Israel/Gaza, Brazil police/gang massacre).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Rates</h2>
<h3>US Macro &amp; Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>US government shutdown</strong> is persisting, with signs it could last well over a month. Key market risks include interruptions to federal data releases (e.g., BLS jobs), SNAP benefit delays hurting consumer spending, and growing chatter about closure of airspace.</li>
<li><strong>Fed Rate Policy</strong>: The consensus outlook is for rate cuts to begin soon (multiple modest cuts through 2025), with only minimal risk of an emergency move or hikes in the near term. The yield curve should continue to hover above 4.3% for the 10-year Treasury, with little chance of falling below 3.5% in the near-term.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation</strong>: Headline and core inflation are running just under or around 3%, with pressures from energy and tariffs surfacing but not yet derailing the “soft landing” consensus. Still, inflation is expected to remain higher than the immediate post-pandemic trend.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Policy</strong>: Budget gridlock and the high probability of continued government spending increases contribute to deficit and US debt growth, creating persistent upward pressure on Treasury issuance and long-term rates.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market/Unemployment</strong>: Unemployment is rising modestly—with mixed job data and persistent layoff headlines—consistent with a cooling but not collapsing labor market.</li>
<li>The US dollar is not facing imminent structural risk (debt default, downgrade, or major monetary policy shock appear unlikely).</li>
</ul>
<h3>International</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>UK and EU</strong>: Focus remains on fighting inflation; rate cuts are likely slower than US, which could weigh on economic revival.</li>
<li><strong>Emerging Markets</strong>: Argentina and Brazil are volatile due to domestic politics, social unrest, and monetary pressures.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitics &amp; Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Trade/Tariffs</strong>: Major focus as the Supreme Court considers the legitimacy and scope of Trump’s tariff regime. Even if partially overturned, tariffs on China and other key economies will remain a disruptive market theme, especially in autos, tech supply chain, agriculture, and consumer goods. Corporates exposed to imports/exports and manufacturing should be watched for earnings risk and surprises from further tariff negotiations or new trade agreements.</li>
<li><strong>Middle East</strong>: Ongoing military activity in Gaza and Lebanon, with risks of broader escalation, but no imminent halt to US military aid or energy supplies. Israel and regional geopolitics pose a continuing headline risk for energy prices and defense stocks.</li>
<li><strong>Russia-Ukraine War</strong>: Little near-term prospect for a ceasefire; further territory likely to change hands. Continued secondary impacts for energy, grains, and risk premiums on European and EM assets.</li>
<li><strong>Asia</strong>: Tensions around Taiwan remain a background risk, though a near-term blockade or invasion still appears unlikely.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors</h2>
<h3>Equities &amp; US Markets</h3>
<ul>
<li>The base case for <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong> and Nasdaq-100 is continued positive returns through year-end, buoyed by resilient earnings, especially in large US tech, and absence of acute credit risk.</li>
<li>Government shutdown noise could add short-term tactical volatility, especially for sectors reliant on government spending (defense, aerospace, infrastructure, federal contractors) and data (real estate, banks), but is not expected to cause a systemic selloff absent deeper fiscal or credit events.</li>
<li><strong>Small caps and cyclicals</strong> may lag large cap tech due to tighter lending, rising unemployment, and budget gridlock.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<ul>
<li>Large-cap tech maintains earnings leadership; <strong>NVIDIA dominates</strong> AI/semis, with Microsoft and Google leading in AI model competition. Apple and Amazon remain stable, with product launches driving sentiment.</li>
<li>No near-term threat to mega cap tech leadership; antitrust and regulatory noise is present (Live Nation, Amazon, Apple), but genuine break-up risk or executive disruptions are remote.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto sector</strong> remains volatile: Bitcoin remains below $120k, with moderate odds of upside surges on ETF or corporate treasury flows, but also frequent dips. Stability of major stablecoins (USDT, USDC) is not under threat.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Industrials &amp; Autos</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>EV sector/Auto</strong>: US and global EV market growth remains a core trend, with select names (Tesla, Rivian) benefiting from deliveries/outlooks and strong government policy support. Tariff and supply chain risk persist, especially on components from China.</li>
<li><strong>Manufacturing</strong>: Tariff uncertainty and rising input costs are hurdles for capital goods, but potential for new trade agreements (esp. with Mexico, India) could shuffle global supply chains and earnings.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy/Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>WTI Oil &amp; Gas</strong>: Prices remain subdued but above critical stress levels. Risks skew more to the downside on weak demand, but with significant event-driven upside tail risk from Middle East or Russia/Ukraine escalation.</li>
<li><strong>Gold</strong>: Has outperformed crypto and is likely to continue acting as a hedge against geopolitical turmoil and fiscal risk.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Estate</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US housing</strong>: Mortgage rates stay elevated near 6%, keeping a cap on affordability and real estate activity, but not collapsing the market. Big rent increases are still expected in NYC and SF.</li>
<li>REITs face headwinds from high rates but may benefit if rate cuts materialize as expected in 2025.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare/Biotech</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sector is steady, with some positive regulatory tailwinds (e.g., potential for Medicare negotiation extensions). No near-term transformative drug/fireworks, but FDA pipeline and new legislation merit ongoing watch.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Names &amp; Corporate</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple</strong>: Continues robust innovation (hardware, software) and product pipeline. No leadership shakeup imminent. Watch for further regulatory scrutiny but tailwinds from services and global device demand.</li>
<li><strong>Palantir</strong>: AI/data analytics growth strong but valuation remains contentious.</li>
<li><strong>AMD, NVIDIA</strong>: Strong chip demand for AI continues to lift earnings and expectations.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla</strong>: Firm delivery/production pace; CEO is steady; new product cycles under watch.</li>
<li><strong>Rivian</strong>: Outperforming peers in the EV space, showing robust revenue/delivery growth.</li>
<li><strong>Live Nation, Amazon, Apple</strong>: Facing regulatory cases, but little sign of immediate breakups or forced concessions.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Key Thematic Risks &amp; Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tariff/Trade war escalation</strong>: Core risk to global manufacturing, tech, and consumer supply chains. Watch legal and policy maneuvers for surprise adjustments.</li>
<li><strong>Government shutdown</strong>: Heightened risk for consumer, defense, and industrials from SNAP delay, delayed spending, or federal activity closure.</li>
<li><strong>Energy shocks</strong>: Still most likely to originate from Middle East war expansion or Russia/Ukraine.</li>
<li><strong>Climate/Natural Disaster</strong>: Major weather events, pandemics, or disasters could abruptly alter insurance, ag, or travel/consumer sectors.</li>
<li><strong>AI/Tech disruption</strong>: Large caps entrenched at the top; key for index leadership. Monitor competitive dynamics, antitrust, and breakthroughs in core AI models.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto</strong>: Remains a speculative/trading instrument with more downside than upside short-term, except as a surge hedge on specific headlines (ETF, large corporate purchases).</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p><em>Remain cautious on event risk, especially around trade/legal shocks, government shutdown duration, and geopolitical escalation. Stay overweight large-cap US tech and gold, nimble in cyclicals/industrials, and defensive on small caps, EM, or high-beta sectors tied to consumer and manufacturing supply chains.</em></p>
