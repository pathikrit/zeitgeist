    <h1>Daily Memo (21-Nov-2025)</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Key News Bullets</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>White House Summit:</strong> Trump and NYC Mayor-elect Mamdani meet, highlighting divergent stances on city/state policy, housing/rent control, and federal-local funding tensions.</li>
<li><strong>Ukraine-Russia Peace Diplomacy:</strong> The US pushes a new Ukraine-Russia peace framework, with Zelenskyy signaling openness to negotiations under pressure; explicit US proposals require significant Ukrainian concessions.</li>
<li><strong>US Politics:</strong> Trump calls Democratic troop messaging “seditious,” escalating partisan rhetoric. Rep. Eric Swalwell launches California gubernatorial bid.</li>
<li><strong>Market/Tech:</strong> Strong focus on corporate/government AI, Nvidia earnings, and potential circuit breaker events amid tech/AI/crypto volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Global Geopolitics:</strong> Israeli military activities in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria continue; major ground offensives remain possible. Strikes in Ukraine (Zaporizhzhia) signal ongoing escalation.</li>

<li><strong>Legal/Regulation:</strong> SEC and FTC scrutiny of Big Tech intensifies; CDC draws fire for shifting position on vaccines; Epstein files saga triggers political/media risk narratives.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Rates</h2>
<h3>US Economy &amp; Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Softening macro:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Forthcoming jobs/CPI data and Powell’s FOMC presser are catalyst-rich. Disinflation or weak labor prints would accelerate expectations for 2026 Fed rate cuts—bullish for duration, high-beta/growth, and gold; bearish for USD.</li>
<li>Conversely, sticky inflation/service prices, or surprise wage gains would see higher yields, dollar strength, and a rotation into value/cyclicals (especially financials, energy).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal composition:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Federal spending inflection: No major spending cuts likely in 2025, but long-term CBO outlook and debt trajectory (&gt;$38T by year-end) to keep term premium elevated. Any prospects of government shutdown/debt ceiling debate (Jan/Feb window) can trigger volatility and a bid into Treasuries/gold.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Credit cycle:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing softening in manufacturing/PMI/retail data; watch for rising delinquencies in Q4 bank earnings (signal on consumer spending and HY credit).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inflation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trend:</strong>
<ul>
<li>CPI, PPI, PCE releases over the next 25 days will likely set the equities vs. bonds narrative for Q1.</li>
<li>Persistent “core” or “supercore” would blunt the 2026 cuts narrative; downside surprise fortifies risk-on/growth.</li>
<li>Energy/food components remain live wildcards for commodities, TIPS, and EM FX.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitics</h2>
<h3>Russia-Ukraine</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Second-order risk:</strong> Probability of a meaningful peace deal or territorial concessions is rising on both US pressure and exhausted Ukrainian resolve.
<ul>
<li>Near-term: Russian offensives continue (Zaporizhzhia, Donbas). A US brokered deal would favor a bond rally, reduce tail-energy/defense premia, and support European cyclicals/FX (EUR).</li>
<li>Prolongation sans peace, or strikes inside Russia (Moscow), or NATO involvement, escalates defense, energy, and commodity risk premia (bullish XAR, DBC, gold; bearish EUR banks).</li>
<li>Ceasefire seen as the modal but not certain outcome by mid-2026.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Middle East</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Israel/Lebanon/Gaza/Syria:</strong> Ongoing Israeli strikes/operations in Gaza and Lebanon—probability of a larger regional escalation remains. Rate of events continues to pose upside tails for oil, defense, and gold; downside for EM FX.</li>
<li><strong>Normalization:</strong> Low-likelihood/longer-horizon of new Middle East normalization (Saudi, Oman, Kuwait) by June 2026; only isolated upside for risk assets in the sector.</li>
<li><strong>Iran:</strong> Minority chance of nuclear breakout or a major US/Israel-Iran clash before 2027; a sharp spike in oil/gold and market drawdowns if realized.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Asia</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>China/US—Structural Competitive Tension:</strong> Tariffs on Chinese imports (semiconductors, autos, consumer goods) forecasted to persist or rise. No meaningful bilateral trade de-escalation by year-end.
<ul>
<li>Dislocation: Further supply chain decoupling; China risk discount persists for semis, supply chains (TSM, AAPL), EM ETFs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Taiwan/SE Asia:</strong> Probability for China-Taiwan military action before 2027 at double-digit but not base-case; outcome determines everything for global semis and supply chains. JPY/CNY volatility to persist if risk intensifies.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Domestic Political Risk</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impeachment/Resignation/25th Amendment risk:</strong> Scenario risk for partial or full-year market volatility events (equity drawback, safe-haven flows to gold/Treasury) remains above historic norms over the next 12-18 months.</li>
<li><strong>Regulation:</strong> SCOTUS, executive orders, and FTC/SEC/DOJ actions can generate headline risk for Big Tech, healthcare, banks, and energy.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Thematic</h2>
<h3>AI/Tech/Semiconductor Cycle</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sector leadership persists...for now:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nvidia still likely to be world’s largest by year-end. Consensus remains structurally bullish AI spending through mid-2026.</li>
<li>However, rising chatter (and prediction market risk) of an AI sector downturn or NVIDIA “de-bubbling” between late 2025–2026: key downside tail is in the event of sudden AI capex pause, regulatory event, or sentiment reversal. Leverage earnings season for edge—Q4 mega-cap guidance and AI datacenter build commentary from MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, AAPL, META will frame factor and risk appetite for H1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Near-term inputs:</strong> “AI Factory,” “RTX/Pro/6000,” and “Nvidia” dominate enterprise IT calls (Dell, HPE), confirming strong demand but increasing market concern about 2026 incremental growth rates.</li>
<li><strong>Chip supply and trade tension:</strong> Probability of fresh semiconductor tariffs against China or NATO/Asian partners remains non-trivial through 2026, sustaining “on-shoring” and capex flows to US, Japan, and KOR semi ecosystems.</li>
<li><strong>Litigation/regulation tail:</strong> FTC/DOJ antitrust pressure on Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon is non-zero; real breakups unlikely before 2027 but legal overhang remains a headline risk.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy, Commodities, and Insurance</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil:</strong> Ongoing Middle East risk (Gaza/Lebanon/Syria) and Venezuela uncertainties combine with climate-related supply risk (hurricane/earthquake/volcanic activity). These keep a floor under near-term oil, gold, and insurance premiums (with positive convexity if conflict escalates).</li>
<li><strong>Uranium/Nuclear:</strong> US/EU policy shift supports renewed nuclear/SMR infrastructure capex and related supply chains out to 2027.</li>
<li><strong>Insurance/Reinsurance:</strong> Tropical storms, US hurricanes, and earthquake/volcanic risk are second-order drivers for local real estate (REITs), municipal bonds, and insurers (and potentially catastrophe bond funds).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consumer, Retail &amp; Travel</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seasonal momentum:</strong> Thanksgiving travel and holiday retail sales are upcoming catalysts with mixed expectations (travel demand healthy; retail trends less clear with labor market softness).
<ul>
<li>Surprises to the upside benefit airlines, hotels, retail, payments platforms; downside bears on small caps, REITs, and banks exposed to consumer credit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Key stock events:</strong> Big-box and department retail earnings (BBY, WMT, TGT, BJ) will set Q4 pace for consumer discretionary and staples positioning.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Volatility and speculation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Stablecoin risks (USDT, USDC, others) are low-noise unless a depeg event emerges; market structure legislation for US DeFi/trading/safe harbor is not seen this year.</li>
<li>Most “new token” launches (Monad, Lighter, Zama, etc.) will drive short-term altcoin volatility but are unlikely to materially change BTC/ETH/$COIN narrative.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Institutional/corporate adoption:</strong> Crossover from S&amp;P 500 treasuries to crypto (BTC) is not imminent in base case, but further corporate accumulation announcements would drive sentiment spikes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>AI/Software IPOs &amp; Private Tech</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>IPO pipeline:</strong> Emerging pipeline (Kraken, Stripe, Glean, Discord, Consensys) likely sees dribble of late-2025 to 2026 listings, not a flood. Watch for cross-impacts from public equity and sentiment: a weak IPO window in late Q4 and Q1 could keep private valuations under pressure and boost potential for PE/strategic M&amp;A, especially in late-stage fintech/AI.</li>
<li><strong>Snapshot:</strong> Some high-mindshare names (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Anduril) will not list before H2 2026 barring a secular tech risk-off retracement.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Names</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>AAPL:</strong> Succession speculation intensifies; John Ternus seen as the clear front-runner for next CEO. Any formal naming may drive governance re-pricing (neutral-bullish vs status quo drift). Product cadence in foldables, Vision Pro, and hardware/AI integration remains the central investor risk.</li>
<li><strong>NVDA/Nvidia:</strong> Still viewed as the world’s largest by market cap through 2025–2026. Any AI sector setback or pausing of incremental hyperscaler demand could rapidly de-rate multiples and trigger broad QQQ pullbacks.</li>
<li><strong>TSLA:</strong> Ongoing CEO succession drama, with low short-term probability of Musk departure before 2027 but rising option value out towards 2026. EV demand softening or meaningful escalation of US/EU tariffs are the dominant risk factors for margin compression and sentiment rollover.</li>
<li><strong>GOOGL/META/MSFT/AMZN:</strong> Regulatory/litigation overhang persists; AI leadership narrative may begin to roll off near the second half of 2026, with second-order upside risk to Alphabet and Anthropic from performance leaderboards.</li>
<li><strong>PLTR:</strong> Continued positive commentary on government/defense verticals; any rise in geopolitical risk, or US/EU defense spending acceleration, will feed through to sector revenue expectations.</li>
<li><strong>COIN:</strong> Sector beta to crypto Spot BTC/ETH ETF flows; listing cadence for altcoins and potential US market structure law will drive 2026 volume and take rates.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Upcoming Catalysts</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Dec 6, 2025:</strong> November US Jobs/Unemployment Report</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dec 11, 2025:</strong> November CPI Inflation</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower core CPI print is risk-on (growth, tech, REITs, gold); sticky core/housing/services supports financials/value/energy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dec 12, 2025:</strong> November PPI Inflation</p>
<ul>
<li>Signals upstream margin pressure or relief for industrials, cyclicals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dec 16, 2025:</strong> November Retail Sales</p>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dec 17, 2025:</strong> FOMC Meeting, Dot Plot, Powell Press Conference</p>
<ul>
<li>Most important rates/macro set up; dovish outcome = bullish bonds/growth stocks, hawkish outcome = value/financials lead, tech multiple compression.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dec 20, 2025:</strong> November Core PCE &amp; Income/Spending</p>
<ul>
<li>Validates/disproves disinflation thesis, informs short-term Fed path.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Late January 2026:</strong> Quarterly Refunding Announcement (QRA)</p>
<ul>
<li>Size/duration of new Treasury issuance will move the curve, steepeners, and duration plays.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>January 2026:</strong> December ISM Manufacturing/Services PMIs</p>
<ul>
<li>Shifts in “new orders” and “prices paid” subindexes lead sector rotations and signal earnings revisions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jan 9, 2026 (expected):</strong> December Jobs Report</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on labor softness, wage growth, sector dispersion for early 2026 rotation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mid-January 2026:</strong> December CPI &amp; PPI</p>
<ul>
<li>Likely reset on rates/equity leadership narrative.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Late Jan–mid Feb 2026:</strong> Tech/Growth Mega-Cap Earnings</p>
<ul>
<li>AI capex/guidance from big 7, plus cloud/consumer narrative—forwards breadth and style risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mid-Jan 2026:</strong> Big Bank Q4 Earnings</p>
<ul>
<li>Early signal for credit conditions and macro risk; watch read-across for lending, NIM, delinquencies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Early 2026:</strong> Potential government shutdown/funding deadline</p>
<ul>
<li>Heightened risk of T-bill, defense, and regional contractor volatility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Late Jan–Feb 2026:</strong> Congressional Budget Office/US fiscal outlook</p>
<ul>
<li>Key input for duration, TIPS, and long-range funding costs. Risks to confidence/reversal in risk appetite if projected deficits exceed baseline.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feb–Jun 2026:</strong> Major SCOTUS decisions (EPA, Tech/Antitrust, Healthcare)</p>
<ul>
<li>Key for regulatory pricing in energy/utilities, big tech (concentration), and managed care/pharma.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Second/Third Order Watch:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Policy/legislative ripple risk from House/Senate control flips in midterms (2026); anticipatory position for federal tax, healthcare, defense, and green capital spending outlook shifts.</li>
<li>Major AI model “leaderboard” shakeup (Gemini, Claude, OpenAI, xAI) could alter capex priorities and disrupt NVDA/AI semis ecosystem.</li>
<li>Extreme outcome (US or UK pulls out of multilateral organizations or NATO) remains outlier, but would trigger broad repricing of risk-off assets.</li>
</ul>
