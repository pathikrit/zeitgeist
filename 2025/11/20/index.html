    <h1>Daily Memo (20-Nov-2025)</h1>
<h2>News Highlights</h2>

<li><strong>US Political/Legal Drama</strong>: U.S. Rep. Cherfilus-McCormick indicted for $5M FEMA fraud. Cheney funeral reunites old guard; Trump/Vance not invited.</li>
<li><strong>Ukraine War—Back Channel Talks</strong>: Reports of back-channel US-Russia plans for Ukraine based on substantial concessions from Kyiv spark alarm among allies.</li>
<li><strong>Israel-Gaza War</strong>: Major Israeli strikes continue; death toll rising, cease-fire shaky. Multiple new strikes in Gaza and Lebanon.</li>
<li><strong>Trump–Mamdani Meeting</strong>: Trump to meet NYC’s Mamdani this Friday; seen as a symbolic posturing re: housing/rent policy, dovetailing with local progressive momentum.</li>
<li><strong>Trade/Tech Tensions</strong>: China-Taiwan-Japan spat escalates with Taiwan symbolically backing Japan on sushi dispute. Biden team seeking new tariff policies on Chinese EVs/solar.</li>
<li><strong>AI/Tech</strong>: Nvidia posts blowout quarter &amp; surges on guidance, fueling AI-mania. Nvidia set to become world’s largest company by market cap per consensus.</li>
<li><strong>Climate/Insurance</strong>: November on track among top-three hottest, per new data. Ultra-processed foods named global health threat. Large storms/hurricanes remain a marginal but monitored risk.</li>
<li><strong>Pandemic/Health</strong>: US on verge of losing measles elimination status; outbreaks rising. CDC shifts on vaccine-autism language under RFK Jr.; vaccine litigation risk rising.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer</strong>: Amazon Black Friday early data strong; deal participation, promotional activity up. Meta warns Australian teens to download data ahead of new-age ban.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Rates</h2>
<ul>
<li>Market expects no Fed rate hike in Dec; 2+ cuts likely in 2026 (not 2025).</li>
<li>Rate cut path, CPI, and jobs data will be strong triggers for asset allocation and curve positioning.</li>
<li>Core CPI and PCE for November should set direction for 2026 duration bets and growth/defensive sector rotations.</li>
<li>GDP growth tracking above trend for 2025 Q4; “soft landing” thesis remains dominant, but forward indicators suggest risk of below-trend growth in 2026.</li>
<li>Long-term inflation expectations steadily above Fed target (3%+ CPI favored in 2025-26), TIPS and commodities remain preferred inflation hedge under persistent bid.</li>
<li>Congressional budget/debt ceiling negotiations and large anticipated 2026 refunding will maintain upward pressure on long-end yields and breakevens.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitics &amp; Policy Risk</h2>
<ul>
<li>Multiple new peace plan “leaks” on Ukraine suggest softening US stance, pushing for Kyiv to accept concessions; Ukraine war increasingly priced as “frozen,” yet further Russian gains around Donbas seen as likely near-term. Energy, defense and EM risk premiums may fluctuate on frontline news.</li>
<li>Middle East escalation: Israeli strikes in Gaza and Lebanon persist; risk of broader Mideast spillover (oil/energy, regional defense) remains well above historic baseline. Markets underprice potential tail events involving Iran, Yemen, or direct Israel-Lebanon conflict.</li>
<li>Multiple high-probability catalysts for political volatility into 2026 (US, UK, France, Israel, Argentina, Taiwan elections, and Japan’s snap election odds).</li>
<li>Domestic US: No-paths seen for sweeping fiscal consolidation; government shutdown odds into early 2026 are non-negligible, but not consensus base case.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Thematic</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Nvidia blowout reaffirms AI datacenter and semiconductor trade as foundational to risk assets for now.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Consensus now expects NVDA to be largest company globally by year-end; AI chip demand and model/dataset arms race show no near-term signs of cooling.</li>
<li>Cloud infrastructure spend driven by AI (NVDA/MSFT/GOOG/AMZN); “AI fatigue/overbuild” not a 2025 risk, but downturn odds increase for 2H 2026.</li>
<li>Antitrust/DOJ/FTC risk for big tech persists (Apple, Amazon, Google under most scrutiny), though any forced breakups or court losses unlikely before 2027.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>OpenAI/Anthropic/Google AI</strong>: Google forecast to remain top AI model at year-end; OpenAI and Anthropic leadership stable into 2026 barring black swan leadership exits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>M&amp;A/IPO</strong>: No major AI, fintech, or crypto IPO expected in remainder 2025; Stripe, Anduril, SpaceX, Kraken more likely to wait until late 2026.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consumer hardware (Apple, Samsung etc.)</strong>: No transformational releases expected in next 9–12 months; Apple foldable and MacBook with cellular in 2026 at earliest.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ongoing Middle East instability is keeping a floor under oil, but lack of broad escalation means only moderate risk premium.</strong></li>
<li><strong>US O&amp;G production healthy; WTI likely to stay in $58–61 band in near term barring geopolitical shock.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gold seen as outperforming Bitcoin in 2025 as global risk events (debt, wars, pandemic tail risk) favor safe-haven flows.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Housing &amp; Financials:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mortgage rates trending lower but sub-6% unlikely by EOY, barring sharp Fed cuts.</strong></li>
<li>Multi-family housing transaction/rate/financing risk elevated; rent growth in NY/SF modestly positive, while rest of US urban Real Estate turns more mixed.</li>
<li>Bank failure/systemic risk risk is not base case but remains a tail to hedge (particularly for high-leverage or high-EM exposure names).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consumer, Retail, and Healthcare:</h3>
<ul>
<li>US consumer remains resilient; holiday sales (Amazon &amp; Walmart) robust.</li>
<li>SNAP/EBT program integrity, minimum wage, and prescription drug pricing risk moderately elevated due to election year noise and inflation.</li>
<li>New litigation waves (Epstein-related and others) driving reputational/legal risk in top universities, banks, and celebrity-related names.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Alternative Assets:</h3>
<ul>
<li>BTC/ETH/SOL remain in high-volatility zone; ETF flows and airdrops driving near-term risk-on/off swings.</li>
<li>Systemic stablecoin depeg (USDT, USDC) not currently priced by market as base case for 2025.</li>
<li>Institutional adoption of bitcoin as treasury asset slowing; S&amp;P500 company BTC buys not imminent.</li>
<li>Token launches/airdrops in new protocols (Monad, Zama, MegaETH etc) are supporting speculative attention but add to tail liquidity risk.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sports, Entertainment, and Betting:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Record media rights deals (MLB, NBA, Netflix entering sports market) reinforce advertising and streaming tailwinds, but valuation risk building among legacy broadcasters.</li>
<li>Sports betting and casino operator stocks see solid volume but face increasing regulatory/hedging costs due to parlay risk and state legislative attention.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Major Company/Narrative Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia</strong>: Third- to first-largest company globally by market cap is increasingly consensus; AI datacenter demand/GLP supply shortage themes dominate. Outperformance priced in; headline-driven volatility risk increases if cloud spend/guidance slows.</li>
<li><strong>Apple/Google/Microsoft/Meta</strong>: Management risk (Pichai, Cook, Jassy) not immediate, but turnover expected before 2027. No major hardware surprise; focus on how further AI rollouts and regulation shape Q1–Q2 2026 earnings/guidance.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla</strong>: No Model Y L or mass-market breakthrough by 2026; robotaxi probability for unsupervised deployment sub-50%. Elon Musk departure risk &lt;5% by 2025, rises medium term.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Crypto: Token Sales, Governance &amp; Volatility</h2>
<ul>
<li>Heavy short-term speculation in token launches (Monad, Zama, MegaETH, Lighter, VOOI etc.); airdrop events generating transaction and volume spikes.</li>
<li>Depeg risk for top stablecoins (USDT, USDC) priced as very low for rest of year. True systemic event would be nonlinear; tail hedge via puts/vol not expensive.</li>
<li>Kraken/Solana/other crypto equity IPOs more likely after 2026; no immediate public market unlocks.</li>
<li>Regulatory/AI convergence (AI tokens, AI governance) starting to affect sentiment—a theme for 2026, not this quarter.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Upcoming Catalysts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nov 27</strong>: US Q3 GDP second estimate—soft landing narrative or weakness in inventory/consumer? Watch cyclicals, high-beta risk.</li>
<li><strong>Dec 2–5, 11, 24</strong>: November ISM (2 &amp; 4), Nonfarm Payrolls (5), CPI (11), PCE (24). All are policy-path critical and shift sector/factor positioning immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Dec 17–18</strong>: FOMC Policy Meeting—sets 2026 trajectory for bonds, equities, USD.</li>
<li><strong>Jan 29</strong>: US Q4 GDP advance—confirmation/reversal on growth. Reassessment of equity long thesis if weakness emerges.</li>
<li><strong>Late Jan–Feb</strong>: Mega-cap tech and bank earnings—AI monetization commentary, loan book stress, credit quality.</li>
<li><strong>Early Feb</strong>: Treasury refunding—size/scope signals for duration risk, liquidity, and private credit competition.</li>
<li><strong>Winter 2025/2026</strong>: OPEC+ meeting—potential energy price swing or volatility on surprise production cuts/boosts.</li>
<li><strong>1H 2026</strong>: US/EU/China tech trade negotiations—watch for tariff moves on semis/solar/EVs.</li>
<li><strong>H1 2026–onward</strong>: 2026 US/UK/France/Taiwan major political event cycle—potential for material sector/factor volatility as policy direction sharpens.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Market regime is “risk-on, but aware,” with soft landing and persistent low inflation expectations dominating, despite undercurrents of fiscal, geopolitical, and credit risk. 2025–26 will be shaped by US/China/EU policy interaction, global rates, and major political cycles. In the near term, core focus remains Fed policy path, AI/tech earnings, and mid-cycle geopolitical shocks. Crypto and sports betting are pockets of froth but not (yet) systemic. Continue to overweight duration/quality in fixed income, own some inflation hedges, and stay underweight sectors/regions with highest policy and EM headline risks.</p>
