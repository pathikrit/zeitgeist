<h2>Macro &amp; Monetary</h2>
<h3>US Economic Outlook</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growth &amp; Recession</strong>: US GDP growth in 2025 is leaning toward modest expansion (1%-2%), with recession risks considered low in the very near term, but persistent jobs and wage pressures may weigh on consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation</strong>: Inflation in 2025 is nearly certain to remain above 3%, with the highest chances in the low-to-mid 3% range. Risks for &gt;4% appear moderate but not dominant. Price growth is decelerating but sticky, likely leaving real yields only slightly positive.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market</strong>: Initial jobless claims at a new four-year high; further softening could test nascent confidence and consumer spending, though wage growth appears modestly above inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Federal Reserve</strong>: Rate cuts expected to be gradual; policy rates likely above 3.5% through late 2025, remaining restrictive longer than consensus expected. Emergency rate moves or new hikes remain unlikely, but a cautious Fed is signaled by persistently high core inflation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stay cautious on long-duration bonds; rates will stay above pre-2020 norms, and bond returns likely remain muted.</li>
<li>TIPS and yield-linked products could buffer against sticky inflation, especially with upside risks to CPI from energy/geopolitics.</li>
<li>Dollar strength to persist in the near term, with some oscillation expected against the euro as EUR/USD volatility rises.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal &amp; Budget</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debt &amp; Deficit</strong>: US federal debt will exceed $38T by end-2025; significant new government spending (&gt;$500B) is highly probable, intensifying long-term fiscal sustainability concerns.</li>
<li>Treasury supply will remain heavy, with upward pressure on yields and possible crowd-out for risk assets in stress scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Treasury/sovereign debt market volatility remains a tail risk. Defensive positioning and staggered maturities prudent for fixed income.</li>
<li>Spurts of market nervousness over debt ceiling, shutdowns, or rating agency action could offer tactical entry points.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitics &amp; Policy</h2>
<h3>Trade &amp; Tariffs</h3>
<ul>
<li>New US-China trade agreements remain unlikely; policy favors selective, adversarial tariffs, especially in sensitive sectors (semiconductors, pharma).</li>
<li>Expect significant new tariffs on semiconductors in 2025; pharma tariffs a rising risk but not fully priced in.</li>
<li>No broad new Congressional tariff law seen for now.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>US companies reliant on Chinese supply chains (tech hardware, generics) face cost risks and potential for further decoupling.</li>
<li>Domestic manufacturing—especially semiconductors—well positioned for volume and pricing power.</li>
<li>Watch for possible outsized volatility in health care and tech supply chains.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Defense and Crisis Risk</h3>
<ul>
<li>Russia-NATO miscalculation risk heightened after drone incidents in Poland; increased NATO resource commitments and broader defense sector tailwinds.</li>
<li>Middle East volatility persists: possible escalation if leadership in Iran changes or Israel-Gaza conflict intensifies.</li>
<li>Low but nontrivial probability of major nuclear/weapons/mass displacement events; these demand ongoing hedges.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Defense sector continues to benefit from elevated geopolitical risk premium.</li>
<li>Energy prices remain vulnerable to new Middle East shocks.</li>
<li>Insurance and reinsurance at risk in event of major natural catastrophes (keep an eye on US/Japan/California earthquake probabilities).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Perspectives</h2>
<h3>Technology/Semiconductors</h3>
<ul>
<li>US semiconductor production is set for substantial double-digit growth this year.</li>
<li>Tariff and trade actions threaten non-US players and integrated supply chains, but support for US fabrication and AI investments is robust.</li>
<li>Large cap tech (Apple, Oracle, others) continue to drive sentiment and sector performance.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pharma sector facing significant policy overhang: US tariff risk is high for China-sourced products; cost restructuring and supply chain actions to accelerate.</li>
<li>Cystic fibrosis drug approval underscores opportunity for differentiated innovation.</li>
<li>Health insurance and hospital sectors should watch for shifting reimbursement, pricing, and wage risks as real wage growth (barely) outpaces inflation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Renewables</h3>
<ul>
<li>Solar installation growth moderate (expect ~30-40GW new US capacity in 2025); further upside capped by policy uncertainty and supply chain frictions.</li>
<li>Oil/gas risks tied closely to Middle East/Gaza scenario and potential surprises in Iran or Russia.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consumer Discretionary &amp; Media</h3>
<ul>
<li>Strong labor market, real wage growth and sticky inflation bolster nominal consumer spending, but shift mix toward value and essentials.</li>
<li>Media/streaming sentiment faces noise from high-profile events, shootings, and delayed content releases (HBO, e.g., &quot;The Last of Us&quot; S3 not seen until well past 2026).</li>
<li>Apple’s price normalization for phones could open the door to more upmarket device launches and ASP increases in hardware.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company and Asset-Specific Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple</strong>: Continued premiumization of product lines drives margins and earnings; watch for regulatory or trade frictions.</li>
<li><strong>Oracle</strong>: Outperforms on cloud/AI exposure; indicative of infrastructure tailwinds.</li>
<li><strong>Semiconductor Leaders</strong> (e.g., Nvidia, Intel): US domestic growth, favorable policy, and potential for trade protectionism.</li>
<li><strong>Insurance/REITs</strong>: Watch out for catastrophe exposure (California/Japan earthquake risk remains in focus for long-tail portfolios).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Risk Monitor</h2>
<ul>
<li>US political instability, contentious leadership transitions, and geopolitics (China, Russia, Iran, Israel, Middle East) require ongoing hedging strategies across risk assets and commodities.</li>
<li>Monitor new developments in AI/cloud, healthcare innovations, trade sanctions, and regional disruptions for sector rotation opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: The macro backdrop is one of persistent inflation, sticky labor challenges, measured Fed easing, and higher-for-longer rates. Policy risks are concentrated in trade (tariffs), defense/geopolitics, and health. Sector leadership is anchored by tech and defense, with cautious upside for US manufacturing and renewables. Monitor debt/fiscal stress and event risk hedges; be tactical amid ongoing volatility in both macro data and geo-strategic events.</p>
