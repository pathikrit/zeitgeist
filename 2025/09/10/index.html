<h2>Macro &amp; Policy</h2>
<h3>US Economy and Fed Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growth</strong>
<ul>
<li>GDP for 2025 is widely expected to remain modest (between 1% and 2%), with little risk of recession this year. Job numbers revised sharply lower, questioning earlier labor strength.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Labor</strong>
<ul>
<li>Unemployment will drift higher, but no spike is expected. Headline growth masks softness in labor participation and underlying job creation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Inflation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Inflation and core inflation are expected to stay in a 3-4% range, not threatening a return to 2022-23 volatility but also limiting any hope for deeply dovish Fed policy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rates</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fed is seen cutting rates multiple times through 2025, but no “shock and awe”—2-3 cuts are probable, larger pivots unlikely barring new crisis.</li>
<li>Market expects long-end rates (10Y) to be capped below 5%, keeping a lid on further bond routs, but little room for big rally barring economic stress.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Implications</h4>
<ul>
<li>Economic and rate expectations broadly bullish for equities, specifically tech, but muted for credit and broad fixed income.</li>
<li>Real estate may get support from the bottoming out of rate hikes, but underlying rental pressure in major metros continues.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal and Trade</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spending</strong>
<ul>
<li>Government outlays are set to sharply increase. Debt will exceed $38T, but this is not perceived as an imminent tail risk for assets, barring a sharp policy misstep (e.g., extended government shutdown).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tariffs/Trade</strong>
<ul>
<li>New and existing tariffs (esp. vs. China, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, EU, Mexico, Canada) are shaping up as a persistent drag on foreign trade. Key tariff cases headed to Supreme Court keep uncertainty high.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Shutdown</strong>
<ul>
<li>Government shutdown risk persists into fiscal negotiations, with market likely discounting a short but not prolonged event. Volatility in Treasuries and USD could spike if standoff lasts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Big Tech</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nvidia is strongly favored to remain the world’s largest company by market cap into year-end, reflecting AI infrastructure advantage and ongoing sector rotation toward compute-heavy plays.</li>
<li>Apple new product event triggers standard cyclical refresh; no major leadership risk at Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, or OpenAI.</li>
<li>Oracle’s outperformance tied to AI/cloud demand. Room for multiple winners in AI capex cycle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>AI Regulation &amp; Legal</strong>
<ul>
<li>AI copyright lawsuits (New York Times vs. OpenAI) and large damages/tort risks remain high for OpenAI (and, by extension, anyone with exposure to generative AI). Policy risk, including US government intervention, is present but not a base case before 2030.</li>
<li>Congressional attention to AI models (e.g., device bans, regulatory review) will grow, but is not yet at a market-moving stage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials &amp; Fintech</h3>
<ul>
<li>Klarna is strongly expected to IPO before Stripe. Stripe’s likelihood of near-term IPO has faded, reflecting weak public market windows for fintech.</li>
<li>Ongoing downward labor revisions and higher-expected fiscal spending suggest a supportive environment for consumer credit, but keep an eye on credit risk if labor softness persists.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li>Political action on drug pricing/advertising and monopoly power could revive periodic volatility in pharma. Risk of sweeping antitrust or monopoly-curbing legislation before 2027 remains low for now.</li>
<li>Public health sector faces challenge from rising obesity and disease trends (obesity, endemic infectious diseases), but no immediate investment impact unless regulation tightens.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Estate</h3>
<ul>
<li>Renters face continued cost increases in major metros (SF, NYC), especially in NYC where aggressive rent hikes are likely. REITs with heavy exposure may capture upside, but affordability concerns could set up political pushback over time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Resources</h3>
<ul>
<li>Solar capacity growth in the US will be solid but not “explosive”; utility and renewables exposure remain attractive for defensiveness.</li>
<li>Volatility in global energy markets is rising after Israeli regional attacks and policy uncertainty, but oversupply keeps oil prices capped. Look for potential pricing tailwinds only if conflict spreads or major new production is disrupted.</li>
<li>US copper and other commodity tariffs are possible, subject to year-by-year strategic policy choices as tariff authority remains contestable.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spot Markets</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin is not expected to see wild price swings down (unlikely to revisit $20k or $50k), but retains meaningful upside potential into the $130-150k range by year-end 2025. Cycle-driven entries are still in play.</li>
<li>Ethereum set to breach $5,000, with moderate upside toward $6,000+ in coming months.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Structural Trends</strong>
<ul>
<li>S&amp;P 500 corporate adoption of BTC is growing, and major new crypto ETFs (Ripple, DOGE) are essentially locked in. Further Wall Street integration is likely, boosting long-term adoption themes.</li>
<li>Systemic risk from Tether remains low; USDT de-pegging or insolvency scenarios are not seen as credible in the near term.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Companies: Events &amp; Catalysts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>NVIDIA</strong>: On track for global market cap leadership. Risks relate to broad AI legal/policy but base case is continued dominance.</li>
<li><strong>Oracle</strong>: Surging on cloud/AI demand. Recent earnings and backlog wins reinforce upward estimate revisions.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI</strong>: Legal risk from NYT and potential for substantial tort damages is high, but IPO expectations are priced in over Anthropic.</li>
<li><strong>MicroStrategy</strong>: Unlikely to sell core Bitcoin holdings; remains a “pure play” on BTC appreciation.</li>
<li><strong>Stripe/Klarna</strong>: Stripe less likely to IPO soon; Klarna is the clearer near-term candidate.</li>
<li><strong>Apple</strong>: Incremental innovation cycle; steady leadership, no big governance risk. Satellite features extended, new watches support wearable ecosystem dominance.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla</strong>: No near-term CEO change, but remains volatile on both industry and idiosyncratic headlines.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Second/Third Order Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continued government fiscal expansion could keep inflation floor stubbornly high, but will likely underpin stocks and risky assets.</li>
<li>Renewed trade wars (tariffs) risk pushing up input costs and perturbing global supply chains, especially in semiconductors, autos, and commodities.</li>
<li>Geopolitical flashpoints (Israel/Gulf, Poland-Russia) threaten volatility spikes. Monitor for energy market and defense sector knock-on effects.</li>
<li>Data reliability questions (BLS revisions) could sharpen investor skepticism about “soft landing” narratives. Watch for increased macro volatility if more data is revised down.</li>
<li>Rental pressure in US urban cores may reignite political/regulatory efforts to cap rents, with potential downstream effects on property-linked assets.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Actionable Themes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Favor large-cap tech, especially AI/cloud infrastructure and chip leaders, over consumer-discretionary “reopening” plays.</li>
<li>Consider real estate positions in urban multifamily, but with awareness of looming affordability/political risk.</li>
<li>Policy/fiscal tailwinds for defense, green energy, and public health, but monitor for headline risk around tariffs and pharma regulations.</li>
<li>Maintain tactical crypto exposure, favoring blue chips (BTC, ETH) and ETF-linked catalysts; discount tail-risk events in Tether or broad depegs.</li>
<li>Monitor legal and political risks to AI platforms and generative tech—exposure to copyright and tort claims remains a persistent shadow.</li>
</ul>
