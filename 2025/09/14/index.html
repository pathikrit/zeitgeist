<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Global Outlook</h2>
<h3>US Economy &amp; Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rates &amp; Inflation:</strong> US inflation in 2025 is heading for a moderately elevated band (3–4%), not returning to pre-2021 low levels soon. Core inflation trends similarly, suggesting a continued environment of higher-than-trend price pressures.
<ul>
<li>The Fed is broadly expected to cut rates during 2025, with multiple cuts possible but rapid easing (4+ cuts) unlikely. Policy rates are unlikely to move dramatically above 4% in the foreseeable meetings, anchoring yield curves and stemming upward pressure on borrowing costs.</li>
<li>Expect range-bound yields but watch for volatility if inflation surprises to the upside.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>GDP &amp; Jobs:</strong> Growth is anticipated to be lackluster (~1–2%), with little risk of recession but also limited upside. This backdrop supports soft-landing equity narratives but continues to challenge cyclicals.
<ul>
<li>Unemployment is expected to hover at or above 4%, pointing to a cooling labor market but not crisis conditions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Government Spending &amp; Debt:</strong> Major new fiscal stimulus is probable, with federal debt surging past $38T. The deficit continues to balloon, pointing to persistent Treasury supply and a market that must absorb ever larger issuances.
<ul>
<li>Watch for rates and credit spread volatility if political events (e.g. possible, though unlikely, government shutdowns or debt ceiling brinkmanship) flare up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics &amp; International</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Europe &amp; Eurozone:</strong> Little imminent risk of near-term “referenda shocks,” but moderate possibility Europe loses a member state by 2030. The discussion itself exposes structural weaknesses and political fragmentation in the eurozone; euro sensitivity remains high, especially if economic or security stress intensifies.
<ul>
<li>Continued unrest (UK, France, Hungary) could destabilize broad European indices and major European banks if risks escalate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>China &amp; US Relations:</strong> China’s moves against US chips before critical trade talks underscore rising economic decoupling. Expect select US semiconductor and supply chain names to remain under pressure in the short term, and risk-off sentiment for global tech value chains.
<ul>
<li>China overtaking US GDP by 2030 is not near-term, but decoupling strategies in supply chains and financial flows may accelerate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Russia-Ukraine &amp; Middle East:</strong> Escalation risk remains in Eastern Europe as Russian drones push NATO’s boundaries and military activity near EU/NATO borders continues. Second-order impact: increased EU defense outlays, higher demand expectations for US/EU defense names, and potential new energy volatility.
<ul>
<li>Instability in Gaza/Israel, with no immediate change in leadership, keeps the region risk premium steady. Watch for sudden spikes if leadership dynamics shift.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Asset Class &amp; Sector Implications</h2>
<h3>Bonds &amp; Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rate cuts are the base case, but the path will likely be gradual; market is already pricing in much of the move. Long-duration Treasuries may see some support, but upward pressure from ballooning supply remains.</li>
<li>TIPS/inflation-protected instruments still relevant given sustained above-target inflation but with less explosive upside.</li>
<li>Corporate spreads to remain stable unless economic surprise or policy error occurs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Equities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Large Cap:</strong> Steady GDP and managed inflation keep a constructive environment for US stocks, especially large caps. However, sustained higher rates weigh on valuation multiples and keep volatility elevated.
<ul>
<li>The dominant tech cohort (Magnificent 7) is likely to remain a market driver, with little evidence of immediate broadening out, though rotation to value remains a possibility if yield curves stabilize.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cyclicals &amp; Discretionaries:</strong> Cool labor market and weak real wage growth temper upside for consumer-facing names; retail and consumer discretionary sectors to remain in a soft patch.</li>
<li><strong>Defensive/Energy/Defense:</strong> Ongoing geopolitical instability increases tailwinds for defense contractors and select energy names. Clean energy and transport tech (e.g., air taxis) benefit from regulatory greenlights and infrastructure spending.</li>
<li><strong>Financials:</strong> Stable or falling rate environment is positive, but any unexpected inflation or market volatility (i.e., a rare but not impossible circuit breaker event) could stress models and balance sheets.</li>
</ul>
<h3>International Markets</h3>
<ul>
<li>European and EM equities face persistent risk from political instability and currency volatility. Any move toward EU fragmentation, even if stepped back, will increase volatility premiums.</li>
<li>Chinese consumer/tech equities benefit from pockets of vibrancy (e.g., Apple preorders), but US-China trade and tech tensions counterbalance sector-specific growth.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commodities &amp; Alternative Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil:</strong> Volatility remains a theme. The modal path is moderate-to-weak oil prices, barring sudden geopolitical blowups. Defensive long exposure may be less attractive in the near term, but optionality for upside should not be discarded given Eastern Europe and Middle East event risk.</li>
<li><strong>Gold &amp; Bitcoin:</strong> Continued US deficit growth and global monetary accommodation keep thematic support for alternatives as hedges, though neither faces a binary moment short term.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto/Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stablecoin systemic risk (Tether) remains a tail, not a base case, risk for broader crypto markets. No major catalyst for either collapse or dramatic upside at present.</li>
<li>Digital dollar or USD stablecoin integration continues, but without disruptive near-term impact.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company-Specific Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple:</strong> Strong Chinese demand for iPhone 17 supports robust international growth and may cushion supply chain/US regulatory headwinds.</li>
<li><strong>US Semiconductors:</strong> Heightened risk from Chinese regulatory retaliation; expect headline risk and potential for volatile trading.</li>
<li><strong>Defense Names:</strong> NATO/EU military build-up and US/EU political rhetoric will benefit primes and advanced weapons suppliers.</li>
<li><strong>Cannabis:</strong> Federal rescheduling remains a possibility but is not imminent; speculative interest stays alive but thesis needs more policy catalysts.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Watchlist Themes</h2>
<ul>
<li>US fiscal and rates path: Treasuries, TIPS, financials</li>
<li>Supply chain/trade retaliation: Tech hardware, US chips, Asian manufacturing</li>
<li>Geopolitical defense/energy: Defense contractors, US/EU energy names</li>
<li>US consumer/labor: Discretionaries, retail, wage inflation</li>
<li>European macro/political risk: Eurozone banks, EU indices, EUR/USD</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The macro narrative is one of “stable but nervy,” with central banks starting to ease, deficits rising, and isolated but significant risks from geopolitics and policy. US growth will stay positive but uninspiring; inflation falls but not to target. Remain alert to second-order risks from European instability, US-China tech disputes, and event-driven volatility in energy and defense. Rotate tactically but stay diversified, with selective hedges on geopolitical and systemic risk.</p>
