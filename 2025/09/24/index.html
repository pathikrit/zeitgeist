<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Rates</h2>
<h3>US Economic Outlook</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recession probability for 2025 remains low</strong>—broad indicators and consensus suggest continued albeit muted expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Government shutdown highly probable this year</strong>; this could generate short-term volatility in Treasuries, spreads, and yield curve steepening.</li>
<li><strong>Fed Policy</strong>: Rate hikes in 2025 are now viewed as extremely unlikely, while multiple cuts remain the base case, though full delivery of 3+ cuts is far from certain. Markets should continue to anticipate a moderate-paced, data-dependent easing cycle.</li>
<li><strong>US National Debt</strong>: Expectations are for new record highs, easily surpassing $38T this year and trending towards even greater fiscal pressure in a Trump administration.</li>
<li><strong>Core Inflation</strong>: Most likely to be moderately sticky (3–4%) in 2025, with few betting on a sharp move lower despite cooling economy. Top-line CPI remains above target, limiting scope for real policy accommodation or rerating of risk assets.</li>
<li><strong>USD Weakness</strong>: Growing likelihood of DXY falling below 95, suggesting strategic risk for USD-based assets and possible US dollar outflows.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Macro &amp; Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>European and Asian Defense Sectors</strong>: Geopolitical risk is materially higher amid unpredictability over US military support and NATO security guarantees. Defense spending and sector outperformance likely, especially in Europe.</li>
<li><strong>China</strong>: Remains slightly less probable to overtake US GDP by 2030, but US tariffs targeting China and USMCA allies remain almost certain. Second-order effect: global supply chains, multinational earnings, and input inflation will remain under pressure.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Themes</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI infrastructure bets accelerate</strong>: OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank’s mega-expansion signals that hyperscale AI buildout is not abating. Nvidia is best-positioned in the near term; second-order beneficiaries include data center REITs, cloud/semicap players, and key energy/minerals for hardware.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory overhang</strong>: The prospect of direct US government intervention or control over AI projects is not negligible by 2030, introducing risk for pure-play AI names and US tech leadership multipliers if regulatory drag increases.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Defense &amp; Aerospace</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>European defense names outperform</strong> on US policy ambiguity; look for continued rerating as Europe rapidly recalibrates its own security posture. US contractors could see volatility around budget, but global sales offset domestic uncertainty.</li>
<li><strong>SpaceX launch surge</strong>: Launch cadence continues to drive space sector optimism, but transformative events (e.g., fully reusable Starship or Mars landings) still look remote in the investable horizon.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>WTI Oil Outlook</strong>: High chance oil prices trade in the $65–$75 range with demand-side pressure outweighing supply shocks. Extreme downside ($55 or lower) less likely; upside breakouts seem limited by subdued macro.</li>
<li><strong>Natural Gas</strong>: Almost certain to remain above $2, but $4+ pricing appears likely at some point in 2025, favoring select gas producers and market volatility trades.</li>
<li><strong>Disasters</strong>: Geophysical risks (earthquakes in CA &amp; Japan, typhoons) have sector/insurance implications—watch for post-disaster pricing moves in REITs and catastrophe-linked bonds.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Pharma</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diabetes ‘cure’ prospects</strong>: While not imminent, ongoing progress points to major upside for gene therapies and late-stage biotech. Drug pricing headlines (Ozempic, Tylenol litigation) foreshadow continued unpredictability in margins and regulatory narratives.</li>
<li><strong>Health crises</strong>: Drug-resistant bacteria, pandemic concerns, and evolving FDA warnings suggest healthcare cost inflation and opportunity for innovation-heavy subsectors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consumer &amp; Demographics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US State Population Shifts</strong>: Major population outflows (10%+ declines) for any state over a decade remain unlikely, suggesting that local REITs and bond exposures are broadly stable for now.</li>
<li><strong>EV Market Share</strong>: Projections now center on 20–30% US share by 2030—positive for first movers but less disruptive than earlier consensus. Autos face competitive margin compression.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company-Specific Notes</h2>
<h3>Big Tech</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple</strong>: New product integrations (wearables, manufacturing) likely, with China supply chain risk a persistent theme. Little expectation of management upheaval in short term.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon</strong>: Expansive AI, robotics, tariff, and supply chain themes will dominate guidance. Margins and diversification into health/delivery persist.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft</strong>: Unlikely to regain world's largest by market cap this year despite sustained AI, cloud, and Activision integration; CapEx discipline is key focus.</li>
<li><strong>Alphabet/Google</strong>: Android PC plans, antitrust, and AI capex expansion feature prominently; little sign of CEO transition risk.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Asset Managers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>BlackRock</strong>: Digital assets, alternatives, and ETF AUM flows remain tailwinds. Performance fee headlines and major private market bets boost confidence; M&amp;A/expansion ongoing despite fee/margin pressures.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin</strong>: Most likely to break above $130k by year-end, with moderate chances for $150k+ rally if broad alternative assets outperform. ETH ATH probabilities lower; SOL upside is more robust short-term but overall crypto/smart contract &quot;flippenings&quot; remain long shots in 2025.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Media &amp; Streaming</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Netflix</strong>: Churn, price increases, major live event launches, and burgeoning gaming efforts to be spotlighted. M&amp;A and competition remain key pressure points.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Second &amp; Third-Order Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Government Fiscal Instability</strong>: Persistent shutdown, debt ceiling, and spending dysfunction raise risk of tail events—potential for credit rating action, cost-of-capital resets, and sector rotation into hard assets or defensive equities.</li>
<li><strong>Global Trade Realignment</strong>: New tariffs force ongoing supply chain reorientation—favors nearshoring, select EMs, and capex-rich industrials. Intermediate inflationary pressure likely.</li>
<li><strong>AI Power Consumption &amp; Resource Constraints</strong>: Accelerating data center expansion will drive up demand for power, rare earths, and specialized infrastructure—favors select utilities, grid tech, and mining equities.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
<ul>
<li>Remain constructive on AI enablers, select defense and energy, digital asset platforms, and global alternatives.</li>
<li>Monitor policy and macro for government dysfunction, shutdown volatility, and supply chain persistency.</li>
<li>Opportune entry points likely in REITs/insurance post-storm/quake, and healthcare innovation for drug-resistance and diabetes solutions.</li>
<li>Risks persist in concentrated mega-cap tech and high-duration assets as macro and policy remain fluid. Favor agility and readiness to rebalance as fiscal, macro, and political events unfold.</li>
</ul>
