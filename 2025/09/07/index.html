<h1>Daily Memo (07-Sep-2025)</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Top News Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Politics &amp; Civil Unrest:</strong> Trump escalates use of federal force in US cities including Chicago, sparking large protests and concerns over “Department of WAR” plans, expanded National Guard deployments, and immigration crackdowns.</li>
<li><strong>US-South Korea Tension:</strong> US immigration arrest operation at a Hyundai plant strains relations with South Korea; negative rhetoric from Trump towards South Korean workers.</li>
<li><strong>US Economy:</strong> Job growth slows markedly, raising fears of an economic stall—even as pro-Trump voices tout an impending ‘boom’. Recession risk remains perceived as low in the next year.</li>
<li><strong>Trade Tensions:</strong> Indications of sweeping new US tariffs targeting China, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, EU, and Canada in 2025. Postal traffic into the US down sharply as a side-effect of trade disruptions.</li>
<li><strong>AI &amp; Antitrust:</strong> AI risks, lawsuits, and regulatory action looming; OpenAI likely facing major damages payouts; antitrust cases against Amazon, Apple, and Live Nation likely to succeed within years.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> WHO adds GLP-1 diabetes/weight-loss drugs to the essential medicines list. New Ebola outbreak in Congo. Mpox no longer global health emergency, but regional risks linger.</li>
<li><strong>Gaza Crisis:</strong> Israeli military attacks escalate, causing further humanitarian displacement and deaths.</li>
<li><strong>Climate &amp; Energy:</strong> Low odds of accelerated solar buildout in 2025; world viewed as highly likely to pass 2°C warming before 2050. Coal and oil remain key energy sources in 2030.</li>
<li><strong>Tech &amp; Supply Chain:</strong> Microsoft Azure and Asian/Mideast internet service disrupted by undersea cable cuts in the Red Sea, highlighting ongoing supply chain and cybersecurity risks.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macroeconomic Outlook</h2>
<h3>Growth, Rates, and Unemployment</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Growth:</strong> Market-based expectations point to sluggish US GDP growth for 2025, with consensus near 1–2% rather than robust expansion.
<ul>
<li>Despite some Trump administration rhetoric about a new boom, hard data and sentiment reflect risks of labor market cooling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rates:</strong> Fed is seen holding or slowly cutting rather than hiking rates in 2025. Emergency cuts or steep rallies in rates are seen as highly unlikely.
<ul>
<li>Rate path towards end-2026: Most projections show rates below 4% by late 2026, with moderate likelihood of two or three rate cuts in 2025—aggressive policy remains off the table barring a shock.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market:</strong> Concern is rising about AI-driven structural unemployment, though headline risk of double-digit US unemployment before 2030 is still not dominant. Some probability attached to unemployment rates climbing into the high single digits over the coming years.</li>
<li><strong>Wages:</strong> Wages are likely to modestly outpace inflation through 2025, implying consumer resilience even as economic tailwinds subside.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal and Trade Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal:</strong> Only one major budget reconciliation bill is expected in 2025, suggesting limited room for further large-scale fiscal stimulus.</li>
<li><strong>Tariffs:</strong> Substantial new US tariffs—especially targeting most major trading partners in Asia (including China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan), Mexico, EU, and Canada—are expected to impact US import costs, supply chains, and multinational company earnings.
<ul>
<li>Revenue from tariffs will be significant but not dramatically higher than recent years.</li>
<li>Second order effects: Expect increased volatility and margin pressures for US and global companies reliant on international supply chains and materials.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Thematic &amp; Sector Risks &amp; Opportunities</h2>
<h3>Technology, AI &amp; Antitrust</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI:</strong>
<ul>
<li>OpenAI faces high risk of liabilities from lawsuits, including major damage payments and potential loss in NYT suit. Regulatory scrutiny is rising, including a possibility of partial government intervention in AI firms before 2030.</li>
<li>Hype around AI IPOs continues—OpenAI likely to list before Anthropic, boosting sectoral attention but also regulatory headwinds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Antitrust:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Courts are likely to rule against Amazon and Apple in antitrust cases within the next few years; Live Nation also faces significant regulatory risk.</li>
<li>This regulatory tightening is a major headwind for Big Tech business models and margins—watch for sector rotations as the market digests enforcement actions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Semiconductors:</strong>
<ul>
<li>US chip output is expected to soar in 2025, underlining ongoing reshoring and supply chain strategic efforts (notably positive for domestic chipmakers, especially those leveraged to AI and high performance computing).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tech Events:</strong> Microsoft and Apple are making major product reveals and battling for leadership—signs suggest Nvidia may become the world’s largest company by year-end, thanks to sustained AI/semiconductor momentum.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy, Climate &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Climate:</strong> The world is on track to pass the 2°C warming threshold by mid-century. This supports continued policy and investment flows toward adaptation, clean energy, and ESG solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Mix:</strong> Despite green policy momentum, oil and coal are still expected to vie with one another for top global energy source in 2030. Renewables, and particularly US solar, are growing—but likely not fast enough to dominate the decade.
<ul>
<li>Traditional fossil fuel infrastructure and associated companies may outperform climate-driven expectations, but longer-term climate liability and transition risks are rising.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>US Solar Buildout:</strong> While growth continues, current year (2025) expansion looks likely to disappoint bullish projections.</li>
<li><strong>Nuclear Fusion:</strong> Still a decade or more away—don’t factor into investment theses before 2040.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Autos, Industrials &amp; EVs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>EVs:</strong> US and global EV market penetration is growing steadily, with probabilities much higher for achieving moderate (20–30%) than majority (&gt;50%) share by 2030.
<ul>
<li>Tesla remains a delivery leader but expectations for massive semi truck output in the next few years should be tempered; growth from energy storage business may also undershoot top-end projections.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tariffs Impact:</strong> Industrials, especially those with multinational manufacturing or extensive supply chains, face new margin and planning risks under the 2025 tariff regime. Expect volatility for US automakers, machinery, and technology hardware.</li>
<li><strong>Space Industry:</strong> SpaceX’s high launch cadence continues—an example of vibrant US private space capital formation—even as Mars goals and key technical milestones remain longer-term.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Biotech</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drugs:</strong> GLP-1 weight-loss/diabetes drugs are now on the WHO’s essential list—supports long-run demand for Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, and advanced biotech with similar portfolios.</li>
<li><strong>Global Health:</strong> Ebola outbreak in Congo (localized risk). Mpox no longer a global emergency but remains a regional concern. Vaccine access and public health infrastructure stress persist, especially in pandemic and emerging health threats.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cannabis:</strong> US rescheduling of marijuana in 2025 is a possibility, but not a base case. Policy reform remains slow.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong> Ethereum has strong momentum for medium targets (e.g., $5,000 by year-end), but less plausible near-term path to extreme price milestones ($10,000+).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company-Specific Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia (NVDA):</strong> Most likely candidate for world’s largest market cap by year-end, reflecting continued AI/semiconductor momentum.</li>
<li><strong>Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT):</strong> Recent events keep these names in focus but regulatory, antitrust, and cyclical headwinds loom—Apple faces likely antitrust defeat; Microsoft battling cloud disruptions and AI regulatory overhang.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon (AMZN):</strong> Significant antitrust risk; multi-front regulatory challenges in US and potentially internationally.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla (TSLA):</strong> Sustainable growth in vehicle deliveries is probable, but mega-bull expectations for truck production and energy business expansion may prove too ambitious for the near term.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Facing material legal and regulatory risk, including risk of blockbuster damages in copyright and liability suits as well as potential market structure changes (e.g., IPO, partial government oversight).</li>
<li><strong>Live Nation (LYV):</strong> High risk of being judged a monopoly—potential for major operational restrictions/spin-offs.</li>
<li><strong>Stripe, Klarna:</strong> Klarna is the frontrunner for a public listing, which could re-anchor fintech and payments valuations, but broader IPO window remains uncertain.</li>
<li><strong>Starlink/SpaceX:</strong> Rapid launch frequency and growing regulatory traction (e.g., potential FAA connectivity contracts), but media and market expectations on Mars missions and satellite recoveries may be overdone.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Forward Watchlist</h2>
<ul>
<li>Implementation and impact of broad new US tariffs (esp. on supply chain names).</li>
<li>Fed’s policy path into 2026—including potential for an accelerated rate pivot if labor or growth falters.</li>
<li>Ongoing US labor market stress, especially in the context of AI/automation-induced dislocation.</li>
<li>AI sectoral legal, regulatory, and antitrust shocks.</li>
<li>Clean energy and utility company adaptation amid slow solar build-out and persistent fossil fuel dominance.</li>
<li>Impact of weight-loss/diabetes drug adoption on health, biotech, and insurance sectors.</li>
<li>Updates on major civil unrest/protests and their economic/geopolitical consequences.</li>
<li>Monitoring for recession signals amidst slowing job growth and global macro crosswinds.</li>
