</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Policy Trends</h2>
<h3>US Growth, Inflation, Employment</h3>
<ul>
<li>Economic outlook remains stable in the near term, with expectations for moderate GDP growth (between 1-2.5%) and very low perceived recession risk for 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Soft landing scenario</strong> is strongly anticipated, with no spike in unemployment or inflation projected, though both remain above pre-pandemic norms (core inflation likely in 3-4% range).</li>
<li><strong>Unemployment risk:</strong> Moderate probability unemployment will tick above historic averages (6-9% range). Labor market resilience is a watchpoint, though not currently a material crisis threat.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Consensus that inflation will persist above 3%, and possibly remain sticky near 3.5%. However, extreme inflation (&gt;5%) is not expected; risk of deflation/very low inflation is negligible.</li>
<li><strong>Fed outlook:</strong> Additional rate hikes are seen as very unlikely. Instead, there’s a significant probability of up to three rate cuts in 2025, supporting risk assets and longer-duration bonds; emergency cuts or drastic easing cycles are not anticipated.</li>
<li><strong>US government shutdown risk</strong> is high for 2025, which could create bouts of volatility in Treasuries and risk assets but is not a trigger for systemic crisis by itself unless prolonged.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal, Debt &amp; Currency</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>National debt:</strong> Strong likelihood for the US public debt to cross $38 trillion, with low odds of breaching $39 trillion this year. This underlines continued pressure on Treasury issuance and longer-term concerns for crowding out private investment.</li>
<li><strong>Debt ceiling / default fears</strong> remain background risk but not a base-case outcome for 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Federal budget and political gridlock</strong> (e.g., shutdown risk, competitive House elections) will reinforce periodic volatility and raise tail risk for Treasuries, TIPS, and related sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Trade/tariff policy</strong>: There is a meaningful chance that pharmaceutical tariffs will be imposed ahead of October, potentially impacting healthcare input costs and sector margins.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global &amp; Geopolitical</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Middle East instability</strong> compounded by increased military action and a low chance of a lasting Gaza ceasefire into 2026. This keeps headline risk elevated for energy/commodity markets and global equities, despite no forecasted acute crises.</li>
<li><strong>UK/European politics</strong>: Symbolic shifts in Middle East policy recognition but unlikely to drive material changes in currency or macro policy near term.</li>
<li><strong>China-West decoupling</strong>: Ongoing concerns about Western asset investability in China; intensifying scrutiny on cross-border capital flows.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Impact Assessment</h2>
<h3>Fixed Income &amp; Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li>With multiple Fed cuts anticipated, intermediate and longer duration Treasuries, high-grade corporates, and TIPS may continue to see support; curve steepening is likely if rate cuts are confirmed.</li>
<li>Government shutdown scenarios can cause near-term volatility but generally favor &quot;flight-to-quality&quot; trades unless default fears re-emerge.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Equities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US indices:</strong> Broad market is forecasted to finish the year positive, with moderate probability of further significant upside in S&amp;P and Nasdaq by end 2025. Downside risk appears low, but volatility from macro/political events should be expected (e.g., shutdown, trade actions).
<ul>
<li>S&amp;P 500: Rangebound between 5,300-7,000 for year-end, consensus towards upper end.</li>
<li>Nasdaq 100: Likely to finish above 24,500.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tech sector:</strong> Positive momentum expected to continue, barring adverse surprises from regulatory or macro factors. AI innovation remains a market driver; no expected paradigm shift in 2025 from AGI or Apple product disruptions.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Risk of sector margin headwinds if pharma tariffs are imposed; monitor US trade policy closely.</li>
<li><strong>Real Estate:</strong> Rent inflation remains strong in key metros—NYC and SF rents poised for significant YoY increases, supporting property-linked cashflows and possibly REIT sectors, but raising affordability and political risk concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Media/Content:</strong> Streaming and box office seeing strong demand for gaming-based IP ('Minecraft Movie'), which could continue to benefit select media and tech players.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commodities &amp; Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil:</strong> Consensus for WTI crude to remain below $75 into year-end; sharp movements above or below lower thresholds appear unlikely unless external shock materializes. Rangebound expectations reduce acute inflation pass-through but lower windfalls for energy equities.</li>
<li><strong>Gasoline:</strong> California prices likely to stay elevated, supporting margin for local refiners and imposing continued cost pressure on consumers; Texas prices more variable but unlikely to drop sharply.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin:</strong> Not expected to challenge &quot;hyperbull&quot; levels ($200-250k+) this year, but moderate probability remains for prices above $130k by end-2025. Major systemic crisis or depeg (e.g., USDT) not a base-case.</li>
<li><strong>Ethereum:</strong> High confidence above $5,000 by year-end; significant upside tail ($7,000+) possible but not probable.</li>
<li><strong>No signs of regulatory or existential risk</strong>—but watch for volatility around major macro policy turns.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Key Individual &amp; Company Events</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple:</strong> No foldable iPhone expected; strong iPhone 17 demand confirms brand stickiness and consumer resilience.</li>
<li><strong>Major M&amp;A, litigation, and high-impact corporate events</strong>: None evident from news flow or near-term catalysts.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI/AGI:</strong> No transformational AI announcement anticipated for 2025, but steady sector disruption to continue.</li>
<li><strong>Pharma, healthcare providers:</strong> Monitor for potential tariffs or legislative-driven cost changes.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Watchlist &amp; Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li>Prolonged US government shutdown or political gridlock around fiscal events (shutdowns, debt ceiling).</li>
<li>Sudden inflation spikes from geopolitical shocks (Gaza, Russia/Ukraine) or supply chain surprises (e.g., cyberattacks on infrastructure).</li>
<li>Regulatory surprises (H-1B visa fees, pharma tariffs) impacting labor supply or healthcare costs.</li>
<li>Real estate affordability as rents spike in major coastal metros; watch for populist policy responses.</li>
<li>Energy/commodity volatility despite muted base-case, especially from unexpected global political escalations.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong><br />
Core scenario is one of enduring market resilience amid lingering, but not acute, inflation and policy risk. Base allocations to broad equity indices, longer-duration fixed income, and inflation-hedged sectors remain favored. Stay attentive to headline-driven volatility, particularly from US political events, Middle East instability, and trade actions affecting healthcare and tech. Leverage policy/political event-driven dips for incremental risk-adjusted gain, but maintain flexibility for outsized tail risks.</p>
