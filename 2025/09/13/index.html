</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Monetary Policy</h2>
<h3>Federal Reserve Policy Outlook</h3>
<ul>
<li>The market overwhelmingly expects multiple Fed rate cuts in 2025; the most likely scenario is two or three cuts, with little chance of rate hikes or an emergency cut.</li>
<li>There is broad confidence that the US will not enter a recession in 2025, and the probability of a marketwide circuit breaker event is seen as low.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Implications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Lower and/or falling rates should support US broad equity valuations, especially cash-generative and tech names, and lower overall market volatility unless unexpected shocks occur.</li>
<li>Expect further downward pressure on yields, particularly at the front and middle of the Treasury curve, with duration risk largely contained barring new shocks.</li>
<li>TIPS and inflation hedges remain a low priority; risk of inflation above 10% is dismissed by markets.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal Policy &amp; US Default Risk</h3>
<ul>
<li>Very low expectation of US budget cuts or debt default. Markets are not pricing in fiscal discipline or near-term sovereign stress.</li>
<li>Macro and rates policy are unlikely to face big volatility from debt ceiling or shutdown brinkmanship in 2025.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Legislative &amp; Political Uncertainty</h3>
<ul>
<li>Republican Party is viewed as highly likely to win Senate control in 2026; House much less certain, implying potential for legislative gridlock but a rightward shift.</li>
<li>Trump's administration faces low probability for high-impact removal or resignation outcomes this year; Fed Chair succession remains uncertain, with a number of mainstream candidates but no clear favorite yet.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2nd order: Expect policy outcomes to be more stable than headlines suggest, but longer-term changes to energy, healthcare, and tech policy should be re-evaluated post-election.</h4>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitics &amp; Exogenous Events</h2>
<h3>Ukraine/Russia &amp; NATO</h3>
<ul>
<li>Little expectation of Ukraine ceding territory but persistent and visible military tension in Eastern Europe, with increased Polish/NATO military alertness.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Implications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Defense sector demand and spending remain strong, and risk premiums on commodities (energy, grains) should remain stable but persistent.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Middle East</h3>
<ul>
<li>UN's support of a two-state solution might marginally cool headline risk, but effects on energy markets are muted unless conflict escalates.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Technology &amp; Innovation</h2>
<h3>AI &amp; Data Centers</h3>
<ul>
<li>AI tech progress continues but no expectation of breakthrough milestones in 2025; AI labor market volatility as seen with xAI layoffs.</li>
<li>Energy infrastructure is under stress from surging demand by data centers, with utilities likely to face capacity and rate pressures.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Implications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Utilities and energy infrastructure stocks may benefit from secular upgrade cycles and pricing power.</li>
<li>Tech (esp. hyperscalers) may face rising costs or public policy scrutiny around power use.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Space &amp; Frontier Tech</h3>
<ul>
<li>SpaceX expected to complete a modest cadence of Starship launches (4-6), suggesting sustainable, but not exponential, ramp in commercial launch/space exposure.</li>
<li>NASA's Mars findings remain more speculative than actionable for investment.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Crypto &amp; Alternatives</h2>
<h3>Outlook for Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin is seen as likely to challenge new highs (above 130K) but with low risk of major crashes, and low likelihood of outrageous price targets.</li>
<li>Ethereum similarly expected to remain robust, with high odds of new cycle highs (5-6K) under current risk appetite and regulatory regime.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Implications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Crypto as a risk asset remains bid in a benign macro, but wild tail events (huge surges/drops) remain de-emphasized by market consensus.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors</h2>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li>Headline regulatory/regulatory risk spikes as vaccine controversy briefly weighs on major biopharma names; short-term volatility possible but fundamental business risks not yet reassessed.</li>
<li>Apple Watch wins medical feature clearance from FDA, strengthening medical device/consumer tech crossover narratives.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Utilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>US policy not expected to materially shift on nuclear in the near term; odds of new reactor approval this year are negligible.</li>
<li>Utility and grid stress offers upside for grid modernization, energy storage, and related suppliers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consumer Tech</h3>
<ul>
<li>Apple remains the most relevant hardware innovator, first with medical features, then with new lineup and carrier partnership activity. Low risk from premium pricing push, continuing its brand and ecosystem lock-in.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Single Name and Idiosyncratic Developments</h2>
<h3>Tesla/Elon Musk</h3>
<ul>
<li>Low probability of a Tesla CEO departure or major disruption soon, but xAI layoffs reflect broader trend of Musk-led firms recalibrating AI and labor assets.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Apple</h3>
<ul>
<li>Event launches and notable FDA clearances maintain Apple's premium and innovation halo. No disruptively priced iPhone yet. No significant product risk from foldable phones in 2025.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Moderna/Pfizer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Headline risk on Covid vaccine scrutiny is front-loaded; further developments could drive volatility in biopharma.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Brief Tactical Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Remain positioned for a benign rate and inflation outlook. Duration risk is less pressing; credit and risk appetite likely to hold.</li>
<li>Tech, energy, and defense maintain constructive outlook; select opportunities in AI infrastructure, grid, and utility upgrades.</li>
<li>Monitor political violence: not yet priced as systemic, but persistent incidents could eventually raise volatility/risk premium if escalation continues.</li>
<li>Healthcare volatility may persist as political-regulatory rhetoric heats, but unlikely to disrupt underlying value chains unless regulatory stance shifts markedly.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Watch for developments in Eastern Europe, regulatory action on AI or crypto, and political event risk in the US this quarter. Energy and utility sector keep climbing on secular trends, not just cyclical moves. Individual tech and healthcare names remain most sensitive to headline-driven swings.</p>
