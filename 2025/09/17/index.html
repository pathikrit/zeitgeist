<h2>1. Macro &amp; U.S. Policy</h2>
<h3><strong>Growth, Inflation &amp; Rates</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>GDP</strong>: Modest U.S. GDP growth is expected for 2025, favoring a 1.1–2.5% band. High growth or recession both remain unlikely. Economic optimism around a “Trump Boom” is strong; upside risk to growth, but this narrative risks disappointment.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation</strong>: Both headline and core inflation are expected to stay elevated, with a strong likelihood above 3% and persistent risk of a 3–4% outcome. Further upward moves (≥5%) seem unlikely but cannot be ruled out if commodity or trade disruptions occur.</li>
<li><strong>Wages</strong>: Wages likely to stay ahead of inflation in 2025, supporting consumption and margins in select sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rates</strong>: The Fed is set to cut rates imminently; the central case is for 2–3 cuts over 2025, with further aggressive easing seen as highly improbable. Shorter-term yields will likely remain above 3.5% into early 2026.</li>
<li><strong>Rates Market</strong>: With a rate cut priced in and mortgage rates at lows, homebuilders and mortgage lenders could see short-term tailwinds; duration risk in long bonds persists due to fiscal instability.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Fiscal Policy &amp; Debt</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spending/Budget</strong>: Major discretionary spending cuts before 2029 appear unlikely but not impossible. Ongoing political brinkmanship could add funding and shut-down risks.</li>
<li><strong>National Debt</strong>: U.S. national debt load will remain high, almost certainly topping $38T by 2025, and is poised to escalate up to $50T under current policy trends.</li>
<li><strong>Tariff Policy</strong>: Trade barriers are set to rise sharply — especially against China, India, and even allies. Increased tariffs risk raising costs, inflation, and disrupting trade-sensitive sectors.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Recession Probability</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short-term (2025)</strong>: U.S. recession risk remains low for now. The labor market is stable, with elevated but not catastrophic unemployment risk by 2030.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2. Global Macro &amp; Geopolitics</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>China/Trade</strong>: Tariffs will hit much of Asia (esp. China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and India). Broad-based tariff hikes on China are expected, some potentially into the ~20–35% range, threatening multinational supply chains and pressuring manufacturing, autos, and consumer electronics margins. The U.S. is unlikely to formally leave major international organizations in the near term but could spur global market fragmentation.</li>
<li><strong>Energy</strong>: Oil and coal will likely remain the dominant global primary energy sources through 2030. Renewables and EVs will continue to grow but will not immediately disrupt legacy energy sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Climate Policy</strong>: U.S. climate targets for 2025/2030 are well out of reach under the current policy mix, challenging expectations for a rapid shift away from fossil fuels.</li>
<li><strong>Conflict</strong>: Geopolitical risks in the Mideast and Eastern Europe persist but no acute crisis in the short term looks market-moving unless escalation occurs.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>3. Sectors &amp; Asset Themes</h2>
<h3><strong>Commodities &amp; Energy</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil/Coal/NatGas</strong>: Expect continued structural strength but cyclicality remains. Tariff risk may drive cost-push inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Copper &amp; Metals</strong>: Copper could be hit by new U.S. tariffs — consider downside risk for major miners, especially with slow EV ramp-up.</li>
<li><strong>EVs</strong>: Despite policy support, the U.S. EV market faces growing pains; market share is likely to rise gradually but not reach majority penetration by 2030. Near-term oversupply, as seen in Rivian’s factory push, could challenge profitability.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Financials</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Private/Fintech IPOs</strong>: Ramp appears poised to go public ahead of Brex; Klarna ahead of Stripe. Anticipate a fintech IPO window, possibly signaling thawing for private equity exits but not broad-based exuberance.</li>
<li><strong>Rates/Financials</strong>: Banks and asset managers should benefit modestly from a stable-to-falling rate environment, but margin pressure from macro volatility remains.</li>
<li><strong>Treasuries &amp; TIPS</strong>: Sustained high deficit and inflation risks boon for inflation-linked assets and select short-duration instruments, but long-end USTs remain vulnerable to supply/demand dislocations.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Healthcare</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Innovation</strong>: Probability of a Type 1 diabetes cure by 2033 is low. Near-term health policy changes (free IVF, meningitis or hepatitis vaccines) are unlikely to be market-shifting.</li>
<li><strong>Policy</strong>: Short-term pressure from shutdown/debt ceiling wrangling might affect healthcare services; FDA’s move on hormone therapy could mildly impact pharma.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Technology</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI &amp; Big Tech</strong>: OpenAI appears the most likely major AI firm to IPO soon, possibly opening the door for renewed AI-sector enthusiasm. Legal risks for OpenAI remain high, which could have industry-wide effects on liability frameworks and insurability.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer Tech</strong>: Apple, Meta, and Xiaomi launches highlight continued platform innovation, but intense competition and tariff risk could squeeze hardware margins.</li>
<li><strong>US-China Tech</strong>: TikTok saga underscores the ongoing deglobalization and bifurcation of the global tech stack.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>4. Individual Names &amp; Watch List</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>OpenAI</strong>: Legal action and potential IPO could move sentiment; follow regulatory risk for major public AI names (MSFT, GOOG, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Rivian</strong>: Proceeding with factory build into a tough market; near-term risk for shares and for broader EV value chain.</li>
<li><strong>Apple/Xiaomi/Meta</strong>: Remain leaders in hardware cycles, but watch for sudden tariff headlines.</li>
<li><strong>Delta, Aeromexico</strong>: Forced partnership breakup underlines regulatory and tradeheadwinds in international air travel.</li>
<li><strong>Financials/Fintech</strong>: IPO read-throughs (Ramp, Klarna) could re-rate private tech valuations and impact listed fintechs.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>5. Key Risks / Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Second-order effects</strong>: Tightening trade policy may lift domestic inflation and weigh on global growth, with some cyclical benefit to U.S. incumbent industries (steel, energy, consumer staples) and supply chain re-onshoring (logistics, infrastructure).</li>
<li><strong>Bond market volatility</strong> heightened by both rising deficit/supply and inflation trends.</li>
<li>**Tech: major litigation/IPO cycles could spur rotation into or out of ‘AI’ and fintech themes.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory risk:</strong> Health and tech sectors face headline, legal, and policy risk; stay agile on positioning.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Favor moderate growth, sticky inflation, cautious optimism on risk assets. Play defense on long bonds, and add a watchful stance on sectors sensitive to tariffs and geopolitical/tech bifurcation. Continue to seek relative winners from inflation protection, tech/IPOs, and opportunistic energy exposure — but beware sudden policy shocks.</p>
