<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Policy</h2>
<h3>Fed &amp; Rate Outlook</h3>
<ul>
<li>Markets expect the Fed to begin rate cuts in 2025, with most cuts concentrated in the 3–3.75% terminal band by year-end 2026.</li>
<li>A recession is seen as unlikely, though not impossible; soft-landing remains the consensus with unemployment tick-up.</li>
<li>Dollar stability vs. JPY/EUR is expected; no substantive devaluation trends detected.</li>
<li>US national debt continues higher, but catastrophic default risk is not rising for now; watch for long-term bond market sensitivity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain constructive but cautious risk appetite—bullish tilt due to continued monetary support, but upside for equities may be capped by sluggish growth and debt overhang.</li>
<li>Long duration nominal bonds are somewhat less attractive, as cuts are largely priced and inflation expectations remain sticky above historical norms.</li>
<li>TIPS attractiveness diminishes slightly—core inflation is not expected to spike, but still running higher than pre-pandemic trend.</li>
<li>USD-denominated assets retain appeal against currency risk.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal Growth Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>High probability bet on a “Trump boom,” but market signals suggest growth will underwhelm optimistic rhetoric. GDP will likely not exceed 2% materially in 2025.</li>
<li>Wage growth is expected to outpace inflation marginally, indicating real income stabilization, but labor slack may emerge.</li>
<li>Trump’s push to scrap quarterly reporting could boost short-term large-cap profitability but could also reduce corporate transparency and raise risk premia, especially for financial and information users.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Thematic</h2>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Natural gas to remain elevated through 2025 ($3–4+), reflecting structural supply constraints and/or persistent foreign demand shocks. Risk for further spikes on geopolitical events.</li>
<li>Oil prices mixed: base case for WTI is volatile, with modest probability of sharp moves either way; global supply/demand disruptions or MENA region escalation remain wildcards.</li>
<li>Little sign currently of an imminent commodities supercycle; focus on regulatory, geopolitical and OPEC+ signals.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology &amp; Innovation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Social media data ownership is at a turning point: Oracle-Silver Lake's likely control of TikTok US would entrench US cloud/data vendors and could drive shifts in ad spend once deal is finalized. Watch for antitrust and privacy battles.</li>
<li>AI competition headlines are cooling; established players dominate, but monitor for surprise new entrant rallies.</li>
<li>Hardware advances (Apple, Xiaomi) emphasize health, battery and connectivity—incremental, not transformative, drivers for the sector near term.</li>
<li>Rivian continues capex despite sector EV overcapacity, betting on long-term demand. Short-term EV sector caution remains appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin and Ethereum remain in an up-cycle, with new all-time highs likely through year-end; systemic risks (such as a USDT depeg or circuit breaker event) remain low but non-trivial.</li>
<li>Watch for regulatory pivots, ETF adoption, and spillover from inflation/fiscal headlines.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Names &amp; Individual Stories</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple</strong> – Software/hardware refreshes keep ecosystem strong but no product cycle catalysts for 2025; satellite comms merits monitoring as competitive inflection.</li>
<li><strong>Oracle</strong> – Poised to take the lead in US social media infrastructure if TikTok deal closes, potentially boosting cloud/data valuation multiples.</li>
<li><strong>Rivian</strong> – Counter-cyclical capex at Georgia EV plant puts them at odds with industry inventory trends; longer-term bullish, but short-term overhang persists.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Second-Order Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>TikTok’s US reshoring may dent Chinese tech competitiveness; also may set compliance precedent for digital content.</li>
<li>Reduced corporate disclosure cadence (proposed Trump reform) could push volatility and widen bid/ask spreads, especially in the financial and information intermediary sectors.</li>
<li>Foreign policy flashpoints (South China Sea, Gaza, Russia-Ukraine) threaten to spill over into commodity and supply chain shocks—stay alert for event-driven volatility in energy and logistics-sensitive equities.</li>
<li>Slow wage growth vs. inflation and labor slack can manifest in future consumer cyclicality, especially retail and housing-sensitive exposures.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Outlier &amp; Long-Tail</h2>
<ul>
<li>No meaningful probability assigned to Mars colonization, but fresh “signs of life” headlines may fuel short-term speculative activity in related equities (space, aerospace, materials).</li>
<li>Volatility spike/circuit-breaker events are not base case but remain possible under low-liquidity, high-headline environments.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br />
Macro regime is shifting toward cautious optimism as monetary support returns but without expectations of a boom. Fiscal, regulatory, and geopolitical noise remain high, but catastrophic downside scenarios are not base case. Within US equities, favor sectors with pricing power and global exposure, maintain modest crypto allocation, and prefer moderate bond duration as yield curve normalizes. Elevated event risk justifies continued diversification and liquidity focus.</p>
