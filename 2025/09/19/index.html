</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro Themes</h2>
<h3>US Economic Outlook &amp; Fed Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soft Landing Expected:</strong> The dominant scenario is a soft economic landing in 2025, with low odds of recession or stagflation. Inflation is expected to remain above the prior 2% target, but not spiral; core readings should stay in the 3-4% zone, with slight risk of upward overshoot.</li>
<li><strong>Fed Rates:</strong> Current and near-term future Fed funds rates are likely to persist in the 3.5%-4% range through 2026, with multiple cuts expected through 2025. Rate hikes or emergency moves are unlikely in 2025 given low recession probability.
<ul>
<li><strong>Implication:</strong> Bond duration positioning should tilt toward intermediate rather than long; falling yields may lag unless surprises arise in inflation or fiscal policy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Wages and Labor:</strong> Real wages are expected to stay ahead of inflation for most, and unemployment should remain low through 2025, with serious jumps in joblessness being a low to moderate risk only beyond the five-year horizon.</li>
<li><strong>Government Debt/Spending:</strong> National debt will significantly surpass $38T in 2025, and government spending is set to rise (not fall) despite rhetoric about fiscal discipline. Fiscal expansion persists, with risk of a government shutdown.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inflation &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Inflation:</strong> A strong consensus that inflation will run above 3% for 2025, with a lower probability of breaching 4%. Any significant inflation overshoot remains a tail risk, but as long as real wage growth persists and Fed communication signals confidence, inflation hedges may underperform.</li>
<li><strong>Commodities &amp; Tariffs:</strong> There is a reasonable likelihood of new commodity and semiconductor tariffs—especially on copper and China—if policy continues in current direction (i.e., Trump administration). Tariff risk is front-loaded for 2025 and could provide relative tailwinds for domestic producers in key materials (industrial metals, semis).</li>
<li><strong>Gold:</strong> Pricing above $3200 is viewed as a high-likelihood scenario for late 2025, reflecting persistent inflation, fiscal risk, and potential international uncertainty.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Macro &amp; Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recession Risks:</strong> Recession appears more likely in Japan and the UK than in the US or China for the near term. Germany is at moderate risk of downturn given EU headwinds and political complexity.</li>
<li><strong>Tariff/Trade Wars:</strong> Tariffs on Asia (notably China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan), select European partners, Mexico, and Canada remain likely. Higher effective tariffs suggest global supply chain friction, favoring domestic US suppliers and adding to moderate upward price pressure in select sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Middle East/Energy:</strong> The Saudi-Pakistan defense pact signals greater regional instability and realignment. If escalation persists, spillover risk for oil/energy/defense sectors rises materially (but not yet at imminent crisis levels).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Style Considerations</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Big Tech (Apple, Amazon, Meta):</strong> Ongoing regulatory/legal scrutiny. Medium chances of courts agreeing that Apple and Amazon function as monopolies; FTC suit news adds to antitrust tailwinds. Meta is not expected to divest Instagram/WhatsApp imminently, but legal overhang persists.</li>
<li><strong>Hardware:</strong> Apple hardware launches are strong but marred by technical glitches; major innovation (foldables, etc.) not imminent. Intel surges on Nvidia synergy—signaling beneficiation for chip suppliers and possible cyclical upturn in semis, but watch for near-term trade/tariff news.</li>
<li><strong>AI:</strong> Short-term transformative AI/AGI progress is still remote; productivity and cost savings from current tech more likely to drive sector stories.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vaccine Policy Volatility:</strong> Federal and state guidance on vaccines diverges (RFK-influenced CDC vs. state blocs), but major disruptions to healthcare business are not expected in the near-term.</li>
<li><strong>Pharma Tariffs:</strong> Some risk of new pharmaceutical tariffs, which would impact supply chains and margins, though not a consensus outcome.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Industrials, Commodities, and Trade</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tariffs:</strong> Trade/commodity tariffs will pressure margins for import-dependent companies. Expect tailwinds for US-based resource and manufacturing companies.</li>
<li><strong>Defense/Aerospace:</strong> US-Europe-Japan-SK defense spending could increase in response to both regional instability (e.g., Middle East) and evolving trade/industrial policy. SpaceX and defense launches remain mostly PR-driven rather than immediately transformative for public equities.</li>
<li><strong>Transport &amp; Aviation:</strong> Easing of supersonic bans appears likely—positive for the aerospace sector, with potential knock-on innovation effects.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials &amp; Bonds</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yield Curve/Monetary Policy:</strong> No near-term Fed hikes; rate path tilts downward but remains high by historical standards. Longer-duration bonds will benefit from slower-than-expected cuts unless macro shocks occur. US fiscal trajectory creates long-term tail risks for Treasuries.</li>
<li><strong>Fintech/Blockchain:</strong> Some probability of Treasury testing blockchain transactions, but not material yet for financial sector earnings.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company-specific &amp; Event-driven</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Live Nation:</strong> High risk of a negative antitrust/monopoly court ruling; FTC suit could force business model changes. Second-order effects for entertainment, events, and music sectors depending on outcome.</li>
<li><strong>Apple:</strong> Regulatory/antitrust risk has increased; hardware launches strong but not revolutionary. Watch for further regulatory news, but business model mostly intact.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon:</strong> Legal vulnerability rising, with the government case for monopoly status more likely than not to succeed in the next three years.</li>
<li><strong>Meta:</strong> Low probability of forced asset sales, but ongoing regulatory risk and reputational overhang.</li>
<li><strong>Intel/Nvidia:</strong> Partnership signals political and technological alignment; positive for US chip equities. Could create defensibility amid tariff or export risks.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla:</strong> No specific macro triggers, but negative headlines around public figures and lingering safety headlines around vehicles.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Actionable Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Macro:</strong> Position for higher-than-target inflation, moderate GDP growth, a soft landing, and rates biased toward gentle declines but not a sustained pivot to easing.</li>
<li><strong>Sector:</strong> Overweight domestic cyclicals, defense, US chipmakers, and gold. Underweight companies with heavy global supply chain and import dependence.</li>
<li><strong>Stock-specific:</strong> Stay cautious around mega-cap tech with legal/antitrust exposure (esp. Apple, Amazon, Live Nation). Monitor Live Nation/Ticketmaster for litigation fallout. See Intel and Nvidia as major short/intermediate term beneficiaries of US policy-driven chip buildout.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical:</strong> Monitor escalation in Middle East and tariff/trade headlines—market sensitivity to these risks is elevated.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Monitor</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fed communications for signals of surprise on rates or QT/QE.</li>
<li>Further strikes/unrest in Europe (especially France).</li>
<li>Ongoing legal escalations for big tech and Live Nation.</li>
<li>Tariff/trade announcements from the US administration, especially on key Asian partners.</li>
<li>Developments in US fiscal policy and government shutdown prospects.</li>
<li>Event-driven names (Meta, Apple, Live Nation, Intel, Nvidia) for litigation and M&amp;A/partnership news.</li>
</ul>
