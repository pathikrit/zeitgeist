</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro Themes &amp; Second-Order Impacts</h2>
<h3>Growth, Employment &amp; Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slowing Growth</strong>: Most outlooks point to U.S. GDP growth below 2%, reinforcing a &quot;slow but positive&quot; trajectory. A minority see downside or stall risk.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market</strong>: Job growth is weaker than previously indicated. Unemployment is trending up, with moderate to high risks of a 4%+ level by September.
<ul>
<li>Second order: Wage growth likely to moderate, consumer spending may soften.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Inflation</strong>: By 2025, core and headline inflation are both most likely to remain in the 3-4% range—a sticky environment relative to long-term targets.
<ul>
<li>Second order: Disinflation to ~2% seems off the table, suppressing expectations of rapid real yield compression or aggressive rate cuts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fed Policy</strong>: Near-term (2025) rate hikes appear extremely unlikely; one cut is not favored unless downside surprises, but the door is open for a few (2-3) cuts if data weakens.
<ul>
<li>Third order: Duration risk in bonds is mixed—upside from rate cuts over next 1-2 years mostly comes if macro data deteriorates sharply.</li>
<li>Longer-run: By late 2026, funding rates in the 3.25-3.75% range are anticipated, much lower than the recent plateau.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal Policy &amp; Dollar</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiscal Expansion</strong>: There is substantial consensus for meaningful federal spending increases in 2025, pushing US debt above $38T.
<ul>
<li>Second order: Higher deficits and debt amplify Treasury supply risk, challenging long bonds, especially if foreign demand wanes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>De-dollarization</strong>: The USD is expected to weaken, with the dollar index likely to set new yearly lows.
<ul>
<li>Third order: This can reflate commodity prices, boost US multinational earnings, and moderately revive global risk appetite for EM assets—although isolated FX crises (see MXN, BRL) may occur.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US-China/EU Trade</strong>: Highly probable 2025 tariffs targeting major economies (including China, EU, Mexico, Japan, S. Korea, Canada) signal a new phase of trade tension, raising global supply chain risk and the prospect of retaliatory measures.
<ul>
<li>Second order: Upstream commodities (e.g., copper) face policy risk; industrial supply chains and select US exporters may be disrupted; inflation in traded goods could see periodic spikes.</li>
<li>Third order: Risk of currency interventions and increased FX volatility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Energy Security</strong>: Middle Eastern conflict, reinforced by the recent Israeli operation, introduces renewed geopolitical risk premium to oil (though longer-term, global demand is still seen as peaking and then shifting).</li>
<li><strong>Climate Disruption</strong>: Wildfire events and debates on risky geoengineering drive up insurance, catastrophe, and construction costs; push for policy innovation.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Themes</h2>
<h3>Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fossil Fuels</strong>: Coal and oil remain the primary global energy sources through 2030, with transition risk to renewables proceeding slower than anticipated.
<ul>
<li>Oil prices: Short-term, volatility remains high, but medium-term outlook sees possible dips (WTI below $65) yet continued spikes are plausible with rebound risk toward $85+ given supply shocks.</li>
<li>Energy equities and oil-linked commodities remain sensitive to both demand and geopolitical shocks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Renewables</strong>: Installation growth persists (especially solar), but headwinds remain for outpacing fossil fuel dominance by the decade's end; watch for policy-driven investment surges or setbacks.</li>
<li><strong>Hydropower</strong>: Ethiopia’s giant new dam reflects EM infrastructure momentum and growing resource disputes, especially in Africa.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Industrials &amp; Trade-Sensitive Sectors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trade Policy Uncertainty</strong>: Manufacturers and exporters exposed to global supply chains face real uncertainty with likely new tariffs (especially those linked to China, Mexico, Japan, Canada, and the EU).</li>
<li><strong>US Manufacturing Onshoring</strong>: Narratives of massive &quot;Trump-era&quot; reshoring are underwhelming, with only marginal improvement expected.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Autos &amp; Clean Tech</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>EV Market</strong>: Substantial penetration expected by 2030 (20-30%+ market share more likely than not), but not yet a true majority commercial displacement; implies solid but not hyperbolic EV supply chain growth.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla</strong>: Marginal production/delivery improvement through 2026; no step-function expansion. Energy business grows, but hitting highest forecast targets appears unlikely. No major low-end vehicle in pipeline before 2027.</li>
<li><strong>Auto overall</strong>: Policy risk is elevated for global automakers due to tariff/FX uncertainty.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Housing &amp; Real Estate</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rents</strong>: Upward pressure continues in key urban markets: NYC and SF rents set to rise strongly in 2025, especially in NYC (possibly &gt;5%).
<ul>
<li>Second order: Suggests tailwinds for multifamily REITs and landlords, but increases political risk for rent control and housing policy initiatives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Big Tech AI</strong>: Google and xAI seen as top contenders for AI model leadership; Apple perceived as lagging in AI innovation, which could suppress sentiment for the name relative to other megacaps.</li>
<li><strong>Hardware</strong>: New device cycles (Apple) could buoy near-term sales, but innovation perceptions may lag market hype.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Currency &amp; Commodities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>USD</strong>: Broadly weaker, supporting commodity prices and earnings for US-based multinationals; possible spot pain for EM FX, particularly MXN and BRL.</li>
<li><strong>EUR/USD</strong>: Major moves above 1.15 are expected, with risk of dips below 1.05 seen as remote.</li>
<li><strong>Commodity Vol</strong>: Both oil and copper face heightened volatility, driven by policy, trade, and geopolitics. Copper faces incremental risk from tariffs.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Stocks &amp; Names</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tesla (TSLA)</strong>: Volume growth expected but not exponential; no cheap Model Y this cycle; upside lever remains in energy but upside capped by operational reality.</li>
<li><strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong>: New device releases, but AI strategy seen as lagging, which may temper further multiple expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Take-Two (TTWO)</strong>: GTA 6 on track for release by May 2026, providing sector upside for consumer discretionary.</li>
<li><strong>US/China/EU Multinationals</strong>: Watch exposure to new tariffs and supply chain friction, especially for industrials, autos, and commoditized tech hardware.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Risk &amp; Tail Scenarios</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Major Downside</strong>: Risks of emergency Fed action, market circuit breakers, or a US default are all low, but not zero—monitor for volatility shocks.</li>
<li><strong>Climate/Disaster</strong>: Cat risk (wildfire, pandemic, geoengineering accidents) is non-trivial; warranting portfolio insurance hedges and scrutiny of insurer balance sheets.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>US macro environment is in a fragile expansion: growth is subdued, labor market softening, rates to stay elevated but fall before 2027.</li>
<li>Elevated government spending and record debt may increase long-end rate volatility, especially if foreign buyers retreat.</li>
<li>Trade/FX uncertainty is at a post-2018 high; select EM and FX pairs face outsized risk, compounded by likely US/EU/China tariff actions.</li>
<li>Energy-sector volatility, gradual buildup of renewables, and solid but unspectacular clean tech/EV growth are the base cases.</li>
<li>Tech sector leadership increasingly hinges on AI innovation; incumbents outside the leaders (Google/xAI) may underperform on weak narratives.</li>
<li>Policy/geopolitical risks—trade, climate, social—will shape second- and third-order effects for both public equities and alternative asset exposures through 2026.</li>
</ul>
