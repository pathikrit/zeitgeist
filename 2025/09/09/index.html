<h2>Macro Landscape</h2>
<h3>US Outlook</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Recession Risk &amp; Core Data</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Odds still favor the US avoiding a 2025 recession, though unemployment is moving higher (above 4% likely in coming months).</li>
<li>GDP growth remains modest; consensus sits between 1.1%–2.5% for 2025, pointing to a “soft landing” scenario rather than overheating or sharp contraction.</li>
<li>Core inflation is expected to persist above 3%, keeping rates elevated by recent standards.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fed Policy &amp; Interest Rates</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Federal Reserve is poised to maintain rates well above 3.5% through 2026. The likelihood of any emergency rate cut or abrupt hike remains low this year; two 2025 cuts are possible but far from assured.</li>
<li>Market pricing signals little likelihood of a significant pivot to easing; rate-sensitive assets may remain volatile. Long-duration bonds and TIPS should be weighed carefully against inflation persistence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fiscal &amp; Debt Situation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>US national debt is all but certain to surpass $38 trillion this year, with further growth into the $40sT likely.</li>
<li>Despite some probability of aggressive spending cuts under Trump, market sentiment expects government spending to increase meaningfully in 2025. Fiscal expansion, barring extreme shocks, supports consumption—but raises long-term cost of capital, especially with rates elevated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trade &amp; Tariffs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tariffs are expected to remain a prominent policy lever—potentially broad-based, affecting China, Mexico, the EU, Canada, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea. High US tariff revenue looks likely for 2025.</li>
<li>Semiconductor and pharma tariffs are on the table, raising risk in supply chains and import costs for affected sectors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Macro</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Europe &amp; Japan</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>France faces political instability after government collapse, implying headwinds for eurozone stability; closely watch for spillover to euro and European equity volatility.</li>
<li>UK stability looks firmer; no immediate PM change expected.</li>
<li>High likelihood of recession in Japan and the UK; Germany similarly at risk. This signals persistent global growth divergence, with US relatively insulated.</li>
<li>Japan's earthquake risk remains moderate to high, adding to regional insurance/REIT caution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>China &amp; EMs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>China's economic catch-up with the US unlikely by 2030; growth remains brisk but constrained by trade friction and domestic headwinds.</li>
<li>US-China tariffs to remain elevated; little sign of major de-escalation.</li>
<li>No new US-India trade deal in the near term, but EM decoupling from China might support other Asian economies (India, Southeast Asia) over the medium term.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commodities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Oil price path is highly contestable: while a modest OPEC+ supply increase offers some upside, stronger probability points to WTI below $65 by year-end. Persistent geopolitical and climate variables could trigger volatility spikes.</li>
<li>Natural gas prices are expected to remain robust ($3+/MMBtu); supply/demand balance offers some support for US producers.</li>
<li>Coal still holds as a major global energy source through 2030, indicating a sluggish renewables transition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector / Thematic Impacts</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>IPO Calendar</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Klarna IPO is imminent ahead of much-anticipated Stripe, OpenAI, and Anthropic offerings. Market attention to fintech IPOs will likely spill over into payment ecosystems and disrupt incumbents’ moats.</li>
<li>OpenAI is likely to IPO before Anthropic, but neither is seen going public in the very near term.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Litigation / Antitrust</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon and Apple both face strong prospects of losing monopoly cases before 2030—a material threat to their ecosystems’ pricing power and operating leverage.</li>
<li>The FTC is keeping Big Tech in its sights, with heightened antitrust scrutiny to persist for the leading US/Europe digital platforms.</li>
<li>OpenAI faces elevated legal risk from tort and copyright claims; reputational and regulatory pressures are set to grow for all foundation model providers.</li>
<li>Anthropic’s settlement over copyright issues is unlikely to end legal uncertainty for AI companies—potential for further liability is high and settlements may not fully mitigate investor risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI/Cloud Infrastructure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Oracle to continue emphasizing cloud, multicloud, capex, and remaining performance obligations in earnings. AI-driven capex momentum is likely to persist, benefiting key cloud hardware/software suppliers.</li>
<li>Growing risk that the US government will attempt to assert control over major AI models or projects before 2030, raising policy and regulatory risk in the AI landscape.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy, Commodities &amp; Climate</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Energy Mix</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fossil fuels (oil, gas, and coal) remain entrenched as the dominant sources of global energy through 2030, although renewables are advancing incrementally.</li>
<li>US solar deployment is growing but will remain well below the most ambitious targets for 2025; upside for equipment and utility providers remains but faces grid and supply chain bottlenecks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tariffs Impact</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Semiconductor sector faces heightened threat from likely US tariffs; expect cost pass-throughs and global realignment of supply chains.</li>
<li>Pharma and biosciences are also vulnerable to new tariffs, increasing cost for US healthcare providers, pushing up inflation in that sector.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consumer, Real Estate, ETFs</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Real Wages and Unemployment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wages are moderately outpacing inflation in 2025, providing a cushion for consumer spending; this underpins consumer discretionary and lending sectors, though low unemployment era is ending.</li>
<li>Higher unemployment likely to pressure lower-tier consumer credits and risk appetite in REITs sensitive to household solvency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Real Estate, Insurance &amp; Natural Disaster Risk</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Earthquake risk for California (and Japan) remains at normal levels—low probability but high impact. Catastrophe-exposed REITs and insurers should be monitored for these rare-event risks, but overall risk premium is unlikely to change markedly in the near term.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crypto</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin is unlikely to reach hyper-bullish price targets, but a plausible path remains for BTC to test and exceed $130k by the end of 2025 if macro/liquidity tailwinds develop.</li>
<li>Digital assets are a core driver for BlackRock and other asset managers; inflows and new product launches likely support AUM and fee momentum near-term.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Names</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Tesla / Elon Musk</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Legal risks persist (Delaware suit outcome uncertain); also potential for Tesla/SpaceX to attract regulatory scrutiny, particularly on antitrust and trade policy fronts.</li>
<li>Probability of Elon Musk dramatically cutting government budgets remains very low; major changes, if they occur, would be slow-moving.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apple &amp; Amazon</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>High likelihood of monopoly rulings against both Amazon and Apple points to meaningful antitrust-driven business model risks. Investors should brace for potential recurring headlines and operational changes over the next few years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Klarna, Stripe</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Klarna's IPO appears imminent, likely preceding Stripe and reshaping valuation benchmarks for global fintechs. Stripe’s timeline for going public is less clear and increasingly facing competitive encroachment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Oracle</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Oracle’s next earnings will likely highlight ongoing cloud transition, heavy capex, and sizeable multicloud/commercial backlog. Earnings surprises will probably be tied to AI/cloud demand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>BlackRock</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Next update to focus on asset growth, digital assets, private market performance, and record AUM—ETF inflows continue to support fee revenue, though margin/valuation pressures persist.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Watchlist: Potential Market-Moving Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Political volatility in US and Europe (Trump-related policy turbulence; French political crisis).</li>
<li>Heightened immigration and trade enforcement point to more frequent industrial/logistics disruptions.</li>
<li>AI, Big Tech, and fintech legal and antitrust battles steadily intensifying—regulatory headlines may drive volatility in those segments.</li>
<li>Elevated government debt and fiscal spending likely to support near-term growth but challenge bond market sentiment and long-term rates.</li>
<li>Unchanged/firmer Fed policy and modest US growth call for defensive sector tilts and risk-aversion in rate-sensitive asset classes.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> US economy is holding up with resilient consumer spending and only moderate inflation. Rates to stay high through 2025–26. Watch for further antitrust actions vs. Big Tech, financials innovation via forthcoming IPOs, and continued uncertainty in energy/commodities from shifting trade policy and OPEC+ moves. Equity index strength continues—punctuated by regulatory, political, or legal shocks. Remain on guard for surprises from tech, global energy, and trade-linked supply chains.</p>
