<h2>Macro &amp; Global Markets</h2>
<h3>US Economic Outlook</h3>
<ul>
<li>US GDP growth for 2025 is generally expected to be modest (~1.1–2.5%), with little chance of unexpected upside or severe contraction.</li>
<li>Inflation will likely remain above 3% through 2025, with further acceleration above 4% much less likely (though not impossible). Wage and input price pressures may persist alongside supply chain disruptions from tightening labor and trade policies.</li>
<li>Near-term recession risk remains low domestically, but thinner job growth, ongoing disinflation, and weak blue-collar data hint at fragility beneath the headline numbers. Surging deficits and ongoing political dysfunction (government shutdown odds are balanced) could add to volatility.</li>
<li>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to begin cutting rates in 2025 (2–3 rate cuts likely), reinforcing a gradually easing environment for risk assets, but still within an inflationary backdrop. Emergency policy shocks or hikes appear remote.</li>
<li>The US deficit is on track to widen further with national debt surpassing $38 trillion credible this year; any material fiscal retrenchment is extremely unlikely until later in the cycle.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Macro</h3>
<ul>
<li>Europe faces heightened risk of stagnation with Germany and the UK both vulnerable to recession over the next 1–2 years. The euro is under pressure, with EUR/USD expected at or below 1.05, partially offset by some resilience in the broader EU, where new member state expansion is probable.</li>
<li>Japan enters a period of uncertainty after PM Ishiba's resignation, stirring yen volatility and raising questions around upcoming economic policy.</li>
<li>China is slowing but not in recession. There is only modest probability of it overtaking the US by 2030. Risks linger over trade (tariffs highly probable) and political leadership stability next year.</li>
<li>Emerging markets: Mexican peso set for further weakness as US tariffs and internal fragilities weigh. Argentina faces new policy volatility as the Milei agenda loses steam. India, on the other hand, is seen as likely to meet climate and growth targets for the decade.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Major Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rising US tariffs are virtually certain across all major trade partners (China, Mexico, EU, Japan, Korea, Canada). Tariff revenues will surge, but massive givebacks could follow if Supreme Court sides with tariff opponents.</li>
<li>Ongoing escalation in Ukraine (largest strikes on Kyiv government to date) and persistent turmoil in the Middle East elevate global risk premia, especially in energy and defense-linked names.</li>
<li>Health risks on the rise again (Ebola outbreak in Congo), though pandemic-scale disruption currently appears remote.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Thematic Implications</h2>
<h3>Energy &amp; Climate</h3>
<ul>
<li>Crossing the 2°C global warming threshold before 2050 is now widely expected; coal and oil will remain the dominant global energy sources through at least 2030, with only gradual renewables share gains.</li>
<li>US and EU climate goals face skepticism, especially for the US, with meaningful shortfalls versus Paris targets likely. Indian progress is more assured.</li>
<li>New regulatory or insurance sector stress is anticipated from increasing climate incidents, impacting both traditional utilities, insurers, and real estate exposures.</li>
<li>Solar installations in the US remain robust, though exponential annual growth is not expected in 2025. Nuclear buildout momentum is stalled for now.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology &amp; Communications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Semiconductor sector continues double-digit domestic growth (+7%), but strong odds of US semiconductor tariffs and cross-border supply chain disruption next year. Broader tech may face heightened antitrust action (Alphabet, Tesla, Meta, Microsoft all vulnerable in near term).</li>
<li>AI sector sees rising risk of regulatory action—US AI safety bills could land, and large-cap names could face new compliance and tort exposure before 2028.</li>
<li>Streaming/entertainment consumption remains strong, but pure AI-generated content is unlikely to make waves pre-2027. Apple product pricing and supply chain inflation could also impact consumer/tech margins.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials</h3>
<ul>
<li>US credit rating appears stable, but tail risk remains from political brinkmanship and deficit blowout.</li>
<li>Expect a positive nominal return environment for equities, supported by rate cuts, but tempered by inflation. S&amp;P 500 projection range leans strongly to the upside (~6,200–6,700) barring shocks, while bullish megacap/AI exposure remains entrenched (Magnificent 7 weight not likely to erode meaningfully in 2025).</li>
<li>Gold and select commodities could see support from renewed geopolitical tensions, and as alternatives in a world of fiscal and trade uncertainties.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Health sector faces turbulence with ongoing regulatory uncertainty (Obamacare risks, shifting vaccine mandates) and questions about product access amid trade and supply shocks.</li>
<li>Welfare programs (e.g., SNAP) still face some threat of restriction, with potential knock-on downside to consumer/retail and staples demand.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Assets &amp; Alternative Sectors</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rising natural disaster risk (US West Coast, Japan) underlines insurance sector vulnerability and potential for REITs with large regional exposure to face unexpected value shocks.</li>
<li>No significant population outflows expected from any US state, keeping residential REITs and related housing plays stable on the macro level for now.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Key Company &amp; Asset Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tesla</strong>: Shareholder approval for Musk's compensation package highly probable; continued regulatory/legal scrutiny (DOT, FTC) and direct competition from new luxury EVs (BMW/Mercedes) warrant monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Apple</strong>: Upcoming iPhone 17 event may telegraph margin/manageable price increases. Watch for global demand signals and supply chain inflation.</li>
<li><strong>Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Tesla</strong>: Rising probability of antitrust/FTC challenges.</li>
<li><strong>Live Nation</strong>: Facing possible monopoly ruling before 2030; may impact sector pricing, M&amp;A, and event operator equities.</li>
<li><strong>Bitcoin/Crypto</strong>: New S&amp;P 500 adoption of bitcoin is increasingly likely. Litecoin faces near-term pressure; Bybit insolvency risk contained for now, but watch for regulatory catalysts.</li>
<li><strong>US Travel &amp; Commercial Real Estate</strong>: United Airlines HQ move unlikely in the near term; broader commercial pressures persist in urban centers.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Actionable Themes / Second-Order Effects</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tariff volatility</strong>: High odds of broad-based US tariffs with direct sector impacts (autos, semis, pharma). Supply chain and price passthrough risks for US and major foreign suppliers; financial sector must brace for potential Supreme Court-driven reversals impacting bond supply/dollar stability.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical energy premium</strong>: Persistent or elevated oil/gas prices supported by war/instability, continued fossil dominance, and climate shocks even as renewables growth remains incremental.</li>
<li><strong>Risk rotation</strong>: Emerging markets exposed to US trade policy (Mexico, China, Korea) and currency volatility; select EM (India) offer relatively bright spots.</li>
<li><strong>AI Regulation</strong>: Potential bill passage could create new compliance costs and legal risk for leading AI and cloud firms; watch for sector rotation or opportunities tied to compliance infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Sector shakeouts</strong>: Ongoing consolidation in streaming, robust box office/entertainment spend, and resilience of AI-centric megacaps support continued growth leadership in major indices.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Bottom Line:</strong><br />
Tail risk (tariffs, recession, government shutdown, geopolitical spillover) remains a persistent concern, but the baseline case is for a moderately favorable environment for risk assets. Watch for pivotal Supreme Court and policy outcomes on trade/tariffs. Persistent inflation and above-trend rates will support value and alternative asset allocations. Sector rotation and stock selection are likely to matter more than broad macro allocations near-term.</p>
