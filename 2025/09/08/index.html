<hr />
<h2>Macro Environment</h2>
<h3>Inflation &amp; Fed Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consensus expects inflation to persist above target for 2025, with the bulk of wagers expecting CPI to rise above 3%. However, risks of outsized price shocks (&gt;4% or 5%) are flagged as possible but not dominant.</li>
<li>The Fed is widely expected to refrain from rate hikes or emergency rate cuts for the remainder of the year. Market pricing implies steady policy, even as unemployment is expected to rise moderately (potentially above 4.1%).</li>
<li>Recession risk for 2025 remains perceived as low, but the labor market shows signs of stress: job gains are thin, and bankruptcies are expected to rise well above long-term norms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Investment Implications</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed income strategy may favor moderate duration, inflation-protected instruments, and should be wary of assuming rapid disinflation.</li>
<li>Risk assets benefit from lack of Fed tightening, but underlying labor weakness suggests fragility—particularly for lower quality/high yield credit.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal &amp; Political Risk</h3>
<ul>
<li>The balance of probability leans slightly toward a US government shutdown in 2025, highlighting ongoing fiscal brinkmanship.</li>
<li>Major tax reforms (corporate or personal) or income tax abolition remain highly unlikely this year. However, political volatility and cabinet turnover in Washington could inject periodic uncertainty and volatility, especially into sectors reliant on government policy/funding.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Investment Implications</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch for short-term disruptions in US government-contracted sectors (defense, healthcare) and core funding markets in the event of a shutdown.</li>
<li>Treasury markets could see periodic bouts of volatility, especially at shorter maturities near shutdown deadlines.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Global/Geopolitics</h2>
<h3>Europe &amp; Asia</h3>
<ul>
<li>France sits at the center of eurozone risk as government finances reach a critical point. Political instability and bond market volatility in Europe could impact global risk appetite.</li>
<li>Japan’s government in transition may prompt further yen volatility and market uncertainty, with broader implications for currency hedges and Japanese equity exposure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Middle East &amp; Russia/Ukraine</h3>
<ul>
<li>The likelihood of an imminent Russia-Ukraine ceasefire remains low, and the latest escalation suggests energy and wheat markets could face further supply shocks if infrastructure is hit.</li>
<li>Middle East instability persists, with potential for wider regional effects given US military movements near Venezuela and continuing unrest in Israel/Palestine.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Investment Implications</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy prices (oil, natural gas, key agricultural commodities) stay vulnerable to headline risk.</li>
<li>European and EM risk premiums may rise; watch for repricing in financials and industrials with cross-Atlantic and cross-Asia exposure.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Thematic &amp; Sector Views</h2>
<h3>Energy &amp; Climate</h3>
<ul>
<li>Global mean temperature on track to breach 2°C above pre-industrial levels before 2050, shaping government policies and climate finance capital flows.</li>
<li>Fossil fuels (coal/oil) expected to remain the dominant energy source through 2030, with gas significant but renewables growing from a lower base.</li>
<li>Catastrophe risks, including an active hurricane season, require close monitoring, especially for utilities, property REITs, and (re)insurance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy transition is lengthy; fossil fuel-linked companies expected to retain cash flows, even as capital shifts incrementally toward renewables and grid infrastructure.</li>
<li>Utilities and property-sensitive assets face higher physical risk premiums due to climate and weather impacts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology &amp; Crypto</h3>
<ul>
<li>AI sector leadership remains centered on incumbents, with little evidence of a challenger breakthrough this year.</li>
<li>NVIDIA stands as the favorite to maintain global market cap leadership among big tech, outpacing other US giants.</li>
<li>Multiple crypto ETFs (Ripple, Doge) likely to gain approval, underpinning further market legitimization.</li>
<li>Bitcoin and Ethereum projections are more bullish than in previous cycles but lack consensus on parabolic outcomes. High-level targets for BTC are possible but not baseline; ETH similarly has upside, but extreme targets are not broadly expected. Stablecoins (USDT) are seen as systemically resilient this year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mega-cap tech weights remain dominant in US indices. Semis and AI-related components remain central to equity performance.</li>
<li>The crypto sector's mainstreaming continues, with regulatory developments favoring increased ETF access and thus broader investor participation.</li>
<li>Earnings and sentiment remain critical for tech names, especially with no major CEO departures anticipated at sector leaders.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Biotech</h3>
<ul>
<li>Low probability of transformative biotech approvals (e.g., Type 1 diabetes cure) in the near term, keeping innovation-driven healthcare stocks reliant on incremental progress.</li>
<li>Cannabis rescheduling has some momentum but is not a given for 2025, potentially limiting upside for sector-exposed industrials and healthcare.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Healthcare remains defensive; upside catalysts will be sector- or company-specific.</li>
<li>Policy developments in cannabis could create niche opportunities but should not be counted on as a base case for major allocations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Defaults &amp; Credit</h3>
<ul>
<li>Elevated bankruptcy and default rates are widely expected in 2025, with far more than historical averages anticipated.</li>
<li>High yield and riskier credit exposures carry heightened risk, especially with macro indicators flashing warning signs for certain parts of the labor market and economy.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>NVIDIA</strong>: Positioned to maintain market cap leadership, reflecting the AI boom’s concentration at the hardware layer.</li>
<li><strong>Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Tesla</strong>: Unlikely to eclipse NVIDIA in size this year; no major leadership shakeups expected, but hardware innovation cycle may underwhelm in the near term.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla</strong>: Faces intensifying competition in luxury EV segment, but remains a key pure-play in a fossil-fuel-dominant world.</li>
<li><strong>Coinbase, MicroStrategy</strong>: Leadership expected to remain stable; crypto-exposed names generally benefit from sector tailwinds.</li>
<li><strong>BMW, Mercedes</strong>: Aggressively expanding EV platforms to challenge existing leaders, representing pressure and innovation for the sector.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Summary Investment Skew</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moderate bullishness on US large-cap tech and AI-adjacent semis continues, led by NVIDIA.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Remain cautious on high-yield credit and non-prime consumer/labor-exposed equities given weak jobs data and high bankruptcy forecasts.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Hold core allocations in energy/commodities; fossil fuel demand remains robust despite climate concerns.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Consider measured exposure to crypto sectors, with ETF approval momentum and regulatory clarity as tailwinds, but avoid speculative extremes.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Watch for volatility triggered by government shutdowns, geopolitical flare-ups, and European/Japanese political instability, and be prepared to hedge as needed.</strong></li>
</ul>
