<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Economic Themes</h2>
<h3>Growth, Inflation, and Labor</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US GDP:</strong> Most likely scenario is modest growth (~1.5–2.5% for 2025). Recession this year is unlikely but moderate risk by 2027 remains; IMF could call a global recession within the next 18-24 months.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Core and headline inflation both appear sticky, generally staying above Fed target (3–4%). September CPI and core CPI are expected to show moderate increases, keeping pressure on real yields. Real wages will likely outpace inflation but not by a wide margin.</li>
<li><strong>Rates:</strong> Market consensus is for 2–3 rate cuts by the Fed in 2025, with very low odds of hikes or emergency cuts. Long bond supply remains high given continued US deficit spending, prompting upward pressure on yields.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market:</strong> US unemployment rate is rising and likely north of 4%, with elevated risk of further increases into 2026. There’s increased likelihood of a significant (&gt;7%) unemployment spike before 2030, potentially linked to AI and automation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal &amp; Debt Conditions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Fiscal Outlook:</strong> Federal deficit continues to balloon, with total debt expected above $38T by the end of 2025 and likely further increases (potentially over $45T) by the end of Trump’s term. While some spending cuts are on the table, they are unlikely to significantly offset the rapid debt growth or growing spending needs.</li>
<li><strong>Spending:</strong> The government is expected to enact at least $500B in new spending for 2025.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Trade, Geopolitics, and Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tariff Environment:</strong> Substantial new tariffs targeting China, Mexico, Canada, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and much of the EU are nearly certain for 2025, with additional sectoral tariffs on semiconductors and possibly pharma very likely.
<ul>
<li><strong>Trump administration trade moves</strong> point to a higher baseline for US trade restrictions, with new free trade agreements possible but not imminent.</li>
<li><strong>SCOTUS support of Trump tariffs</strong> further decreases legal risk for these measures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>International volatility:</strong> French political crisis and Argentine instability create new sources of volatility for EU and EM risk. Emerging market bond/equity risk premiums rise, especially in affected regions.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Implications</h2>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fossil Fuels:</strong> Oil and coal are expected to remain the world’s largest energy sources in 2030, reflecting slow progress on global decarbonization. Recent OPEC+ moves reinforce near-term pricing power for oil.</li>
<li><strong>Renewables:</strong> Renewables (including solar) will grow but are unlikely to surpass fossil fuels in share by 2030. EU may stall on 2030 climate goals, while India likely will meet its targets, opening opportunities in Indian renewables and related infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Nuclear/Utilities:</strong> High probability of US military-backed nuclear-powered data centers in the coming years could stimulate investment in small modular nuclear, especially for sensitive applications.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology / AI / Cloud</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Regulation:</strong> US AI safety legislation is a true toss-up for 2025. Immediate risk is more likely centered on supply chain (DeepSeek ban) than broader regulation. OpenAI faces high risk of significant ($1M+) legal liability by 2028.</li>
<li><strong>Tech IPOS:</strong> No near-term IPO signals for most high-profile, late-stage US SaaS (Airtable, Cluely, Rippling), but Ramp (fintech) is an exception and may proceed ahead of rivals (Brex, Stripe). OpenAI is the most probable AI IPO ahead of Anthropic but neither is imminent.</li>
<li><strong>Semiconductors:</strong> New tariffs likely in 2025, hurting importers and global supply chains—expect volatility and potential margin compression for exposed hardware/software names.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pharma, Biotech:</strong> US pharma firms face risk of new tariffs and only a remote chance of tougher anti-monopoly legislation before 2027—likely more headline risk than material margin compression in the short term.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare Policy:</strong> No major overhaul imminent (IVF coverage extremely unlikely to become universal).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Defense &amp; Aerospace</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defense:</strong> Anduril likely to go public before 2027, reflecting strong pipeline for defense tech IPOs. Heightened geopolitical tensions (Middle East, US-China trade) should support sector flows and defense contractor order books.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials &amp; Crypto</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crypto Markets:</strong> BTC and ETH have decent odds of new all-time highs before 2026, but sky-high targets ($1M BTC) are not in play. Uptake in DeFi and crypto trading platforms continues, with Kraken's IPO a key event to watch.</li>
<li><strong>DeFi/On-Chain:</strong> New projects (like Plasma, Monad, WLFI) expected to launch with strong initial funding, reflecting growing appetite for high-risk crypto exposure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Estate &amp; Insurance</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>California:</strong> Large earthquake risk remains present but not acute for the next few years—headline-driven reinsurance spikes more likely than actual catastrophic loss, but be alert to changing probabilities if tremors increase.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company-Specific / Idiosyncratic Factors</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple:</strong> CEO change in 2025 very unlikely; focus remains on hardware cycle and possible upgrade driver from rumored &quot;iPhone Air&quot;. Watch for supply chain or China exposure given tariffs.</li>
<li><strong>Google/Alphabet:</strong> CEO change risk is low; maintain focus on cloud, AI, and regulatory developments.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon:</strong> Very stable management; focus on logistics and cloud, especially as cross-border e-commerce faces cost inflation from trade friction.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Leadership seen as stable over the next year, but heightened legal risk is relevant for Microsoft and partners.</li>
<li><strong>SpaceX:</strong> Aggressive launch cadence (160–179 launches in 2025 likely) plus major spectrum acquisition points to further industry consolidation and satellite broadband proliferation.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Takeaways &amp; Near-Term Watchpoints</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short-term equity sentiment is positive,</strong> but persistent inflation and stickier unemployment are limiting upside for broad indices. Policy risks (tariffs, labor actions, French/Argentina/EU politics) are the main sources of volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Bond investors face challenging environment:</strong> continued large deficits and slow disinflation put upward pressure on yields, despite some support from expected Fed rate cuts.</li>
<li><strong>Favor energy, Indian renewables, defense, and selective tech (AI/automation, cloud) exposure.</strong> Be wary of US/China supply chain plays, broad manufacturing, and heavily tariff-exposed names.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto/DeFi:</strong> Remain constructive on BTC/ETH, but treat moonshot price targets skeptically.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor September CPI, unemployment, and Fed communications closely.</strong> Inflation surprises or jobs data could shake expectations for cuts and drive market direction.</li>
<li><strong>French, Argentine, and Gaza developments</strong> are credible macro risks for FX, rates, and EM/commodity-trading strategies.</li>
