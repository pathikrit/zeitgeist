<h2>Macro Overview</h2>
<h3>Fiscal Policy, Recession, and Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Fiscal Outlook:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Accelerated federal spending likely in 2025; high confidence in at least $500B increase, supporting continued deficit growth.</li>
<li>US National Debt widely expected to surpass $38T this year (near consensus). Debt-to-GDP ratios will stay below crisis territory for now but will increase market sensitivity to future rate spikes or policy changes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Recession &amp; Growth:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Market assigns moderate probability to US or global recession before 2027; while base case remains continued growth, recession risks cannot be ignored.</li>
<li>GDP growth for 2025 is most likely in the middling 1.6%-2.5% range, with upside or downside surprises not entirely off the table.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Inflation/Rates:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Both headline and core inflation are expected to remain sticky, clustering mostly in a 3-3.5% band through 2025, above the Fed’s target and suggesting persistence in price pressures.</li>
<li>Wage growth is likely to continue exceeding inflation, with housing (rents) as a persistent driver of core CPI.</li>
<li>Rate cuts: High probability of at least three rate cuts by the Fed in 2025, marking a shift to easing bias, but ultra-dovish surprise (emergency cuts or rate hikes) appears low-risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Second-order Effects:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Higher nominal rates, sustained wage pressures, and deficit spending underpin stagflationary risks but don’t signal an outright recession; positive backdrop for select equities, commodities with pricing power, and inflation hedges.</li>
<li>Treasuries and TIPS to benefit from rate normalization and cut expectations, but rising debt and fiscal expansion will raise tail-risk premia.</li>
<li>Uncertainty from the election cycle could create episodic volatility in macro assets and sectors sensitive to defense, healthcare, and US-China relations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector and Thematic Insights</h2>
<h3>Trade, Tariffs, and Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tariff Regime:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Trump seen as very likely to implement sweeping tariffs (notably 30-40%+) on China, Taiwan, Mexico, the EU, Japan, South Korea, and Canada—with near-term action on healthcare/pharma and semiconductors.</li>
<li>Second/third-order effects:
<ul>
<li>Upward pressure on US consumer and producer inflation, particularly for goods and supply-chain-exposed categories.</li>
<li>Chronic headwinds for multinationals with significant non-US manufacturing; supply chain reorientation (nearshoring, Mexico, Southeast Asia) to benefit industrial landlords, logistics, and select US manufacturers.</li>
<li>Export-driven countries (Germany, Japan, SK, Taiwan) and firms in autos, chips, pharmaceuticals disproportionately exposed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>China, Emerging Markets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Direct negative for global growth, especially for EM exporters. Turkey risk is elevated with Erdoğan predicted to continue to dominate politics.</li>
<li>Lower commodity prices (oil, soybeans) signal sluggish global demand, weighing on EM assets—although Argentina/China disrupting US agriculture exports also lowers the floor for US farm incomes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy/Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fossil Fuels:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Consensus points to weak oil and natural gas prices (&lt;$65 WTI; muted drawdown risk for natgas this winter), likely due to tepid global demand offsetting supply risks.</li>
<li>This is a net negative for energy sector profits, export-dependent economies, and inflation hedges tied to oil.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Renewables and Energy Transition:</strong>
<ul>
<li>US solar installations expected to continue robust growth (especially above 30GW), consistent with federal support, but not at blowout levels; modest windfall for utilities exposed to renewables, but not a sector game-changer for 2025.</li>
<li>Substantial probability of direct US investment in lithium supply (notably Lithium Americas), reinforcing long-term EV/battery supply chain resilience. This could prompt re-rating of US battery, EV, and lithium mining equities.</li>
<li>Second-order: Likely more regulatory and capital inflows into US-centric supply chains, with select support for industrials, mining, and renewables.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Estate and Housing</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rent and Property Trends:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Substantial rental price increases expected in NYC and San Francisco (NYC &gt;6%, SF &gt;2%); residential REITs and property owners may outperform versus inflation in these metro markets.</li>
<li>Elevated rents further entrench consumer inflation, supporting the case for inflation-protected assets.</li>
<li>NYC mobility still below pre-pandemic levels; mixed read-through for office and retail REITs, but housing demand remains solid.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Alternatives &amp; Crypto</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gold vs Crypto:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gold expected to materially outperform Bitcoin in 2025; continued macro risk, sticky inflation, and potential for risk-off flows underscore the attractiveness of gold over more speculative alternatives in the near term.</li>
<li>However, long-term and corporate adoption narratives for Bitcoin remain alive (another S&amp;P 500 company is moderately likely to add BTC to its balance sheet by 2026).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Crypto Trends:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin and Ethereum have strong support above current levels, but probability for extreme upside ($150K+ BTC, $10K ETH) remains modest; more moderate rallies are favored.</li>
<li>Major airdrops (Monad, MegaETH) anticipated into 2026, with DeFi protocols trending higher. Solana's all-time high is plausible, but not consensus.</li>
<li>Regulatory uncertainty remains, especially regarding national reserves or government-level crypto policy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual/Company-specific Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tech:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Google and Apple leadership turnover risk negligible for 2025; company strategy continuity likely.</li>
<li>TikTok US business likely to be stabilized under American stewardship (Oracle, Silver Lake, MGX), removing a key overhang for US social media/advertising incumbents.</li>
<li>Amazon faces short-term reputational and financial impact from FTC settlement, but long-term business franchise resiliency remains.</li>
<li>Starbucks is restructuring with targeted closures and layoffs—watch for continued cost optimization and how management navigates margin pressure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare/Pharma:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Drug tariffs increasingly likely and could spill into higher healthcare costs; expect margin pressure for US-based pharma importers or companies dependent on non-US supply chains.</li>
<li>Milestones in gene therapies and cheap HIV prophylaxis may drive sector rotation and positive sentiment in select biotech names, especially those with strong regulatory or IP barriers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Second &amp; Third Order Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Trade escalation and tariffs may re-anchor inflation higher in late 2025, challenge global earnings forecasts, and create differentiated sector winners/losers.</li>
<li>Increased US fiscal spending and infrastructure investments could offset macro drag for capital goods, certain tech, and construction industries.</li>
<li>Rent inflation creates a stickier overall CPI; sustained wage increases may shift consumer behavior, helping discretionary names with pricing power but hurting those exposed to lower-income spenders.</li>
<li>Persistent global and domestic political risk warrants higher hedging (gold, TIPS, select defensives) and focuses attention on “home-shoring” and domestic supply chains.</li>
<li>Geopolitical and security risks around energy, food supply, and tech platforms will continue to drive regulatory and market volatility.</li>
</ul>
