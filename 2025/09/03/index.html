<h2>Macro &amp; Market Outlook</h2>
<h3>Economic Growth &amp; Debt</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>GDP Growth (2025):</strong><br />
Expect U.S. GDP growth to moderate, most likely in the 1.6-2.5% range. Odds are low on very high or negative growth.</li>
<li><strong>US National Debt:</strong><br />
National debt is almost certain to surpass $38 trillion by year’s end, with further increases toward $40T+ looking probable for subsequent years. No major spending cuts expected, and government outlays are set to increase at least $500B, possibly more.</li>
<li><strong>Treasuries &amp; Rates:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Treasury yields remain elevated, partly in response to debt concerns and uncertainty around executive influence on Fed independence.</li>
<li>Consensus is toward no Fed rate hikes or emergency cuts in 2025. A modest pace of rate cuts (possibly 1-2) is more likely, with rates staying above 3% through 2026.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Implications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Duration risk in long-dated bonds remains high; favor TIPS, floating rate or laddered approaches for fixed income.</li>
<li>Watch for renewed pressure on USD and risk assets if political brinkmanship or fiscal standoffs escalate.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Labor Market &amp; Wages</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unemployment:</strong><br />
Unemployment in late 2025 should remain manageable (~4.1%), but expectations trend upwards for higher unemployment before 2030.</li>
<li><strong>Jobs Numbers:</strong><br />
Slowing but positive jobs growth, with most revisions tending downward.</li>
<li><strong>Wages vs Inflation:</strong><br />
Wages are likely to outpace inflation modestly in 2025, supporting consumer staples and discretionary sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Noncompete Agreement Ban:</strong><br />
Low-to-moderate risk that the federal ban on non-competes could be overturned before 2030, which would marginally increase labor fluidity and wage pressures in select industries.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Implications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Support for consumer-driven equities persists, but monitor labor cost pressure if unemployment rises more quickly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inflation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>2025 Core CPI:</strong><br />
Inflation remains sticky but is trending downward: expect core CPI to center around 3-4%, with little probability of a return to 6%+ or sub-2%.</li>
<li><strong>Gas &amp; Energy Prices:</strong><br />
Gasoline is likely to remain volatile, especially in California (risk of $5/gal+) and Texas ($3/gal+ not unlikely), tracking ongoing energy market stress.</li>
<li><strong>Commodities:</strong><br />
Natural gas prices appear set to remain above $3, with spikes above $4 likely. Oil remains highly volatile; both sharp pullbacks and rallies are possible, but downside risk is prominent.</li>
<li><strong>Second-Order Effects:</strong><br />
Higher-for-longer energy costs could continue to support upstream energy equities, but suppress margins for manufacturing, logistics, and airlines.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Asset Classes</h2>
<h3>Equities</h3>
<h4>US Broad Indices</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>S&amp;P 500:</strong><br />
High confidence in positive index performance through 2025—soft landing scenario dominant, with most scenarios seeing the S&amp;P closing 2025 well above current levels. Expect continued sector rotation: tech and healthcare resilient, cyclicals and defensives should be selected carefully.</li>
<li><strong>Nasdaq/Tech:</strong><br />
Nasdaq-100 faces valuation ceiling, but bottom-up tech strength persists pending continued AI/cloud innovation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Risk</h4>
<ul>
<li>Marketwide circuit breaker event is a low-likelihood tail risk for 2025 but should be hedged for.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commodities &amp; Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy Mix:</strong><br />
Oil and coal will continue to be the largest global energy sources in 2030; despite aggressive renewables growth, especially solar, the transition will not overtake fossil fuels in the medium term.</li>
<li><strong>Renewables Installations:</strong><br />
US solar capacity will continue to build; expect another record year but with persistent cost and grid-integration bottlenecks (30-40GW capacity likely, with upside surprises dependent on policy).</li>
<li><strong>Oil &amp; Gas:</strong><br />
Expect volatility around WTI, with potential for both price spikes (geopolitical or supply disruption) and sharp corrections (global slowdown, oversupply fears).</li>
<li><strong>BRICS Expansion:</strong><br />
Watch for BRICS adding new members before 2027, which could shift commodity market share and energy trade patterns.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tether/USDT risks:</strong><br />
Market does not anticipate insolvency or a major depeg this year, but ongoing regulatory and stability tail risks persist.</li>
<li><strong>Gold/Bonds:</strong><br />
Flight-to-safety trades remain valid with treasury/debt jitters. Gold supported by fiscal and geopolitical headlines.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company &amp; Legal</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Antitrust Watch:</strong><br />
High anticipation of antitrust cases designating both Apple, Amazon, and Live Nation as monopolies by 2030. Remedies remain unclear, but regulation risks for tech giants are growing.
<ul>
<li>Potential second-order effects: Increased opportunities for smaller players and cloud vendors, more scrutiny on digital advertising ecosystems, and impacts on M&amp;A.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI:</strong><br />
Medium-high probability of a pending large civil payout before 2028, suggesting legal and regulatory risk in AI development and deployment.</li>
<li><strong>Litigation Themes:</strong><br />
Market expects Rippling to prevail against Deel; ongoing litigation environments worth tracking across private tech.</li>
<li><strong>Oracle &amp; BlackRock Earnings:</strong><br />
Oracle earnings will be driven by cloud backlog, RPO, infrastructure growth, and AI commentary, with Stargate and multicloud as key strategic themes.
BlackRock’s calls will focus on continued ETF inflows, private market growth, digital asset strategies, and potential margin pressures.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitics &amp; Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>China/Russia/North Korea Alignment:</strong><br />
Escalation in anti-US rhetoric and military capabilities. Potential ramifications for defense, semiconductor, and energy sectors. Watch for more persistent trade and tariff shocks.</li>
<li><strong>Israel/Gaza &amp; EU:</strong><br />
Continued instability and EU policy drift; Israel's Gaza operation may drive further humanitarian and energy shocks.</li>
<li><strong>US Political Stability:</strong><br />
Despite rumor cycles, market does not expect presidential succession or removal in the near term. Courts currently restraining some more extreme executive moves.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Watchlist: Risk &amp; Opportunities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rate Policy:</strong><br />
Watch for any dovish Fed surprises or market-driven rate instability.</li>
<li><strong>Debt Ceiling / Fiscal Standoffs:</strong><br />
Debt and spending trajectory could force risk repricing in treasuries and equity volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Risk:</strong><br />
Further foreign alignment against the US could trigger shocks to dollar, energy, and global logistics.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Mix Transition:</strong><br />
While the clean energy buildout offers long-term opportunity, near-term fossil fuels remain structurally important with regulatory and demand risk more than supply-side constraints at this stage.</li>
<li><strong>Tech &amp; Antitrust:</strong><br />
Monitor progress on antitrust proceedings against mega-cap tech names.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market Inflection:</strong><br />
If unemployment rises faster than expected or wage-inflation dynamics shift, recalibrate consumer, housing, and retail sectors.</li>
</ul>
