<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Global Themes</h2>
<h3>Inflation, Rates, and US Economic Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inflation is widely expected to surpass 3% this year. Despite strong inflationary pressures, the probability of a 2025 Fed rate hike remains extremely low, and recession odds for 2025 are also quite small.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Second-order effects:</strong> Higher-than-desired inflation without corresponding rate hikes may compress real yields, undermine long-duration bonds, and support risk equities in the short term.</li>
<li>US GDP growth expectations remain robust, with a notable chance of a significant economic boom under the Trump administration.</li>
<li>Trump’s policy environment points toward a hawkish trade/immigration stance, little expectation for high-earner tax cuts, and a focus on spending control (though large-scale cuts and agency elimination look less probable).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Potential trade policy volatility:</strong> Recent court setbacks inject uncertainty into US tariff strategy; industries exposed to global supply chains and imports (e.g. autos, electronics, manufacturing) should be monitored for policy risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Labor:</strong> Unemployment is likely to remain historically low but could face upward pressure if immigration restrictions persist and labor policies tighten.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>EU:</strong> Expansion is probable before 2030, while the risk of a member exit remains non-negligible, increasing medium-term euro volatility and regulatory/tax fragmentation potential for multi-nationals.</li>
<li><strong>US-China:</strong> China's prospects to surpass the US in economic size before 2030 are not strong, suggesting a continued competitive landscape but no imminent power shift.</li>
<li><strong>Russia/Ukraine:</strong> Ongoing conflict with little prospect of ceasefire in the near term means continued defense sector demand and European energy risk premia.</li>
<li><strong>Asia shake-up:</strong> High probability for leadership change in Japan may entail policy shifts internally and for Japanese assets, but limited global macro spillover unless coupled with regional instability.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Asset-Class Takeaways</h2>
<h3>Energy, Commodities &amp; Climate</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy mix:</strong> By 2030, oil and coal are projected to remain just as critical as renewables, with no imminent transition, despite climate urgency. Commodities in these areas could retain pricing power.</li>
<li><strong>Climate stress:</strong> Continued warming above 2 degrees is highly likely, with accelerating extreme weather and insurability challenges hitting re/insurance, agriculture, infrastructure, and ESG-focused investment products.</li>
<li><strong>Nuclear:</strong> US military may move forward with nuclear-powered data centers, reflecting broader long-term bullishness for nuclear equities and uranium.</li>
</ul>
<h3>US Real Estate and REITs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demographics:</strong> No US state is likely to see large-scale depopulation, maintaining broad stability for US-based REIT exposures.</li>
<li><strong>Labor and immigration:</strong> Federal crackdown has removed over a million immigrant workers, likely to exert upward pressure on wage costs for certain property classes (logistics, agriculture, hospitality), potentially reducing REIT profit margins.</li>
<li><strong>Housing policy:</strong> Administration is prepping robust responses to housing costs, possibly via stimulus or regulatory easing, which would be bullish for residential REITs and construction-related equities.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI dominance:</strong> Google is tipped to hold the top AI model over alternatives. The government assumes some chance of direct control over major AI projects, inserting regulatory risk.</li>
<li><strong>Semiconductors:</strong> NVIDIA remains the clear favorite to be the world’s largest company by year-end, underpinning supply chain relevance for advanced chips.</li>
<li><strong>Antitrust:</strong> Litigation risk is high for both Amazon and Apple as monopoly cases are likely to bring regulatory heat and potential business model constraints.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials, Crypto &amp; Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong> Bitcoin and Ethereum are expected to remain volatile; substantial new highs (BTC above $130,000, ETH above $5,000) are plausible, but do not appear extreme. ETF approval trends for altcoins (Ripple, Doge, Cardano, Litecoin) are highly favorable, boosting institutional legitimacy and liquidity.</li>
<li><strong>Fintech IPOs:</strong> Klarna is likely to IPO ahead of Stripe; Ramp is ahead of Brex. Speculate on value realization among private fintechs as public market access is unlocked.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li>Major regulatory moves (possible partial or full reversal of Obamacare) are plausible but not dominant. FDA approval of breakthrough diabetes cures remains unlikely within the decade, so diabetes pharma status quo remains largely intact.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company-Specific and Named Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tesla/EV sector:</strong> Moderate rise of global EV adoption, but well below “majority of new sales” threshold by 2030. Supportive for lithium and related supply chains.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet:</strong> Potential to remain world’s top market cap firms diminished versus NVIDIA’s strong positioning.</li>
<li><strong>SpaceX:</strong> Maintaining dominance in commercial satellite launches; increased venture capital flow into space sector.</li>
<li><strong>Live Nation</strong>: At significant antitrust risk, which could affect long-term business structure.</li>
<li><strong>US Banks:</strong> Stability for now given slim odds of recession, emergency rate cuts, or significant unemployment increases in the short term.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Watchlist</h2>
<ul>
<li>Monitor Q4 inflation prints, September macro data, and updates on US housing stimulus discussions.</li>
<li>Follow legal proceedings on US tariffs, Big Tech antitrust, and regulatory action in the AI/crypto space.</li>
<li>Track defense and energy-related activity arising from continuing Russia/Ukraine, US/China tensions, and G7 leadership changes.</li>
<li>Prepare for increased climate and insurance volatility as warming accelerates, with continued severe weather and natural disaster coverage stress.</li>
</ul>
