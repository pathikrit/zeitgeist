<h2>Macro &amp; Market Outlook</h2>
<h3>Interest Rates &amp; US Fed Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>The consensus view is for no further Fed rate hikes in 2025 and a high chance of at least one rate cut by year-end, likely commencing as soon as the September meeting.</li>
<li>Multiple rate cuts (more than two) remain finely balanced, but a flurry of cuts or emergency moves appears highly unlikely unless a new economic shock emerges.</li>
<li>Treasury yields are not expected to spike above 4.6% with any persistence, and even less so to 5.5%. This should keep bond markets relatively stable but raises a modestly bearish outlook for long-duration bonds if inflation surprises on the upside.</li>
<li>U.S. recession/stagflation risk remains subdued in the near to medium term. Economic data is not forecasting negative GDP prints for Q3 2025; labor market and consumer spending appear resilient.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Expect a &quot;slow pivot&quot; environment: equity multiples supported, risk assets steady, but beware signs of sticky inflation or exogenous shocks (see Geopolitics).</li>
<li>Short-term, minimal upside for Treasuries from duration extension. Credit, real assets, and “risk on” trades could continue outperforming unless inflation unexpectedly rebounds.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal Policy &amp; Debt</h3>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. national debt is overwhelmingly likely to exceed $38 trillion in 2025. No major tax cuts for high earners are expected.</li>
<li>Potential noise around fiscal sustainability could reemerge, though actual spending restraint appears unlikely. Ongoing deficits could sustain pressure for higher long-run rates, but current bond supply is not yet triggering acute market stress.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While not yet impinging on 2025 returns, cumulative debt must be monitored for secondary impacts on the USD, TIPS, and long-term bond yields.</li>
<li>Higher debt may modestly boost case for inflation-protected instruments if fiscal credibility deteriorates.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Views</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tech leadership (“Magnificent 7” stocks) is not expected to diminish as a share of the S&amp;P 500; concentration risk persists.</li>
<li>AI remains a central theme, with big tech companies and the administration (both presidential and first lady’s initiatives) pushing hard on education and public adoption.</li>
<li>Legal/regulatory risks: Warner Bros. Discovery’s lawsuit against AI company Midjourney highlights growing IP and copyright headwinds for AI model developers, though these do not yet threaten core earnings for established public tech giants.</li>
<li>Hardware/semi (semiconductors): AI hardware demand (NVDA, AMD, TSMC) remains robust, with low risk of sudden AGI breakthroughs impacting business models in 2025.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stay overweight dominant large-cap tech, especially AI/semiconductor supply chain.</li>
<li>Watch for policy-generated volatility around AI ethics, IP lawsuits, or education sector AI adoption.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Blockchain</h3>
<ul>
<li>BTC’s outlook is relatively bullish: probability is skewed toward remaining above $70,000, with a fair chance of reaching $130,000 by end-2025 but limited odds for &quot;moonshot&quot; upside.</li>
<li>$ETH is even more likely to clear the psychologically significant $5,000 mark this year.</li>
<li>LTC and ADA ETF approvals are anticipated—boosting mainstream access, but no seismic re-rating for other major coins expected.</li>
<li>Little regulatory threat for crypto outside litigation on bad actors; stable macro backdrop should support moderate further gains.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain/accumulate core BTC, ETH positions; incremental upside for altcoins with ETF news, but alpha likely lower.</li>
<li>Take profits opportunistically on major surges above $130k for BTC.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consumer &amp; Retail</h3>
<ul>
<li>U.S. summer tourism is set for a notable decline, impacting airlines, hotels, leisure/travel, and related commercial REITs. Caution on near-term consumer discretionary exposures.</li>
<li>Lululemon’s guidance disappointment and margin warnings stand out as a canary in the coal mine—supply chain normalization and tariff-induced cost increases are biting. Retailers dependent on discretionary spend or imported goods may underperform.</li>
<li>Amazon/Netflix cutting perks (Prime, password sharing) suggests ongoing cost discipline amid customer growth plateauing. Possible normalization of margins rather than growth.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Underweight travel &amp; leisure, airlines, hospitality, and fashion retail.</li>
<li>Focus on consumer names with pricing power or essential spending orientation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li>No major new supply or demand shocks identified; Norway’s elections likely to preserve prevailing energy policy and support NOK stability.</li>
<li>China-driven risk for both energy and metals is stable absent escalation over Taiwan.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Health, Insurance, and Natural Disaster Risk</h3>
<ul>
<li>US hurricane season remains active; only a slim chance of a below-average storm count. Insurers and reinsurers may again see above-average claims—monitor insurance pricing and loss ratios.</li>
<li>Rising heart/blood pressure issues (and new AHA guidelines) could buoy health providers and device makers, but negative findings on some heart drugs may impact certain pharma/biotech firms.</li>
<li>New Ebola outbreak in DR Congo: humanitarian and health security risks globally, worth tracking for tail events but not directly investable.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitics &amp; Policy</h2>
<h3>US Politics &amp; Regulation</h3>
<ul>
<li>No dominant left- or right-policy shocks expected, but ongoing legal actions, agency disputes, and federal/state tension present background noise.</li>
<li>Trump’s administrative initiatives highlight a willingness for unilateral headline-generating acts (defense rebranding, strikes on foreign vessels) which may raise risk premia under certain scenarios, especially for defense contractors or firms exposed to sudden geopolitical escalations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Risk</h3>
<ul>
<li>China/Taiwan: While a rapid military escalation is not the base case, risk is no longer &quot;tail only&quot;—heightened attention to semiconductors and Asia-exposed narratives.</li>
<li>Iran: Authorization for military action or a nuclear test remains a low-probability but high-impact scenario. Monitor defense, energy, and havens if speculation intensifies.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Key Single-Name/Idiosyncratic Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Waymo vs. Uber:</strong> Waymo is not likely to overtake Uber’s SF share in 2025—autonomous mobility penetration remains a slow thematic play.</li>
<li><strong>Bezos/Washington Post:</strong> Some noise around a possible sale, not base case; limited direct equity impact unless paired with broader digital media M&amp;A.</li>
<li><strong>NVDA/AI stocks:</strong> Continue to lead the AI growth charge; no disruptive inflection in AGI expected in investable timeframe; risk skewed to upside for chipmakers.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Summary Investment Thesis</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Maintain risk asset allocations</strong> – macro environment remains steady with accommodative-to-neutral Fed, limited risk of shocks barring geopolitics.</li>
<li><strong>Overweight large-cap tech/AI, semiconductors, crypto</strong> – secular tailwinds, policy support, and product innovation continue to drive returns.</li>
<li><strong>Exercise caution in consumer discretionary, travel, and retail</strong> – consumer headwinds from tourism/retail, cost inflation likely to impact Q3/Q4 earnings.</li>
<li><strong>Selectively overweight insurance and health providers</strong> amid rising natural disaster risk and shifting health trends.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor defense and commodities</strong> for event-driven opportunities linked to rising geopolitical rhetoric or sudden policy moves.</li>
<li><strong>Watch for policy/administrative tail risks</strong> – legal, regulatory, or executive actions could produce volatility but not structural headwinds absent an exogenous crisis.</li>
</ol>
