<h2>Macro Themes</h2>
<h3>US Policy Turn: Hard Power, Regulation, and Spending</h3>
<p>Recent moves by the Trump administration—including renaming the Pentagon and taking high-profile legal actions—signal a decisive move toward a more aggressive defense posture, tighter immigration enforcement, and a shift in regulatory climate. With DOJ probing Fed independence and new political pressures on the central bank, expectations are rising for increased fiscal spending (especially defense), while monetary policy credibility may weaken.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Second-Order Effects:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Higher government outlays (defense, law enforcement) could stimulate near-term GDP but may challenge longer-term debt sustainability and borrowing costs.</li>
<li>Increased defense spending likely boosts the US defense supply chain.</li>
<li>Market volatility risk if monetary policy credibility is questioned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Security Risks Escalating</h3>
<p>Incidents in the Caribbean (US-Venezuela) and East Asia (China military parade, North Korea ties) underscore a broad rise in geopolitical tensions. Israel’s new offensive in Gaza and postwar security talks in Ukraine highlight persistent instability across several regions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Third-Order Effects:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Higher global defense budgets, sustained demand for military technology and cyber solutions.</li>
<li>Energy and commodity volatility (potential supply disruptions from new or expanded conflict zones).</li>
<li>Flight to safety, possible pressure on USD and Treasurys if risk-off sentiment spikes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Labor Market Softening; Fed Cuts Anticipated</h3>
<p>Consensus builds around a slowing US labor market, with employment data in focus ahead of potential Fed easing. Any dovish surprise could invigorate equities, but credibility concerns around a politically pressured Fed could undermine market confidence in the medium term.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Second-Order Effects:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Near-term support for risk assets if rate cuts appear imminent.</li>
<li>Value of inflation hedges (gold, TIPS, commodities) is mixed: possible short-term volatility as inflation trend remains ambiguous.</li>
<li>High sensitivity to further economic data volatility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Analysis</h2>
<h3>Defense &amp; Aerospace</h3>
<ul>
<li>Direct beneficiaries of US defense renaming/revitalization efforts. Potential upside from foreign instability (Ukraine, China, Venezuela) and renewed US/EU defense pledges.</li>
<li>Longer-term risk of defense budget constraints if deficits worsen or debt markets react negatively.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tech &amp; Big Tech</h3>
<ul>
<li>Regulatory climate has shifted dramatically in favor of US tech giants: Antitrust pressures fading, White House/CEO detente. Risk appetite remains strong, with AI and consumer hardware trends highlighted at IFA 2025.</li>
<li>Third-party clouds, semiconductor, and US-based platforms may see capital inflows.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Utilities &amp; Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li>SoCal Edison and other utilities face mounting wildfire-related litigation risk; regulatory uncertainty high especially in West and Southwest.</li>
<li>Global energy volatility rises with conflict risk around Venezuela, Middle East instability.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Biotech</h3>
<ul>
<li>Vaccine and health policy cleaves US into red/blue spheres; prospects for winning/losing regions differ based on alignment with federal and state policies.</li>
<li>Sweetener/cognitive decline data introduces potential for litigation and reform in food/agrochemical sectors.</li>
<li>Chagas and Ebola outbreaks could spur renewed funding for diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Risk/Opportunity Signals</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>High-profile leadership churn:</strong> Northwestern presidency, Spanish and Thai PM uncertainty do not pose systemic financial risk in the short term, but sector/local volatility possible.</li>
<li><strong>Google, Facebook benefits:</strong> Big Tech emerges stronger post-antitrust, and with AI innovation momentum. Risks around data privacy and new consumer product pivots bear watching.</li>
<li><strong>SoCal Edison:</strong> Legal risk elevated, possible negative spillovers to peers with wildfire exposure.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Investment Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strategic overweight</strong>: US defense and aerospace, Big Tech, AI hardware and software leaders.</li>
<li><strong>Cautious positioning</strong>: US utilities (litigation risk), culturally/politically exposed healthcare names, firms with outsized exposure to soft retail labor markets.</li>
<li><strong>Tactical hedging</strong>: Maintain flexibility for spike in volatility; monitor Treasuries and gold for safe-haven flows if macro/political credibility deteriorates.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Outlook Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Near-Term Tailwinds:</strong> Tech and defense as regulatory/policy outlooks favor expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Key Risks:</strong> Political volatility, central bank interference, escalation of global hotspots, structurally higher legal and climate event costs for utilities.</li>
<li><strong>Watching Closely:</strong> Payrolls data, Fed reaction, unfolding legal/political battles, headlines on defense outlays and global conflict escalation.</li>
</ul>
