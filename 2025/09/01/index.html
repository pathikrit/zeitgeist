<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Policy</h2>
<h3>US Inflation, Rates &amp; Fiscal Position</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stubborn Inflation:</strong> Most likely, US inflation will remain above 3% for 2025, with core measures also persistent. This indicates ongoing price pressures and challenges for households and businesses, especially in rate-sensitive sectors (real estate, consumer durables).</li>
<li><strong>Fed Policy Outlook:</strong> Multiple cuts are possible in 2025, but more than two is unlikely; a &quot;wait and see&quot; stance dominates. Rate hike or emergency cut scenarios are very low probability.</li>
<li><strong>US 10Y Treasury Yield:</strong> While spikes &gt;4.6% are not base case, upward pressure remains plausible due to sticky inflation and rising debt. Yields north of 4% remain a risk for duration-heavy bond exposures.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Dynamics:</strong> US debt is likely to surpass $38 trillion by end-2025. No sign of resolution—attention warranted to potential crowding out, effects on the dollar, and government financing costs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Implications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Real rates may rise slower than hoped; TIPS and short-duration bonds still merit consideration.</li>
<li>Persistent inflation supports cost-push pricing power in equities, but margin pressure will rise for labor-intensive and heavily leveraged firms.</li>
<li>Fiscal strain: tail risk for currency depreciation and potential shift in appetite for US sovereign debt.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Growth &amp; Recession Chances</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Recession in 2025/6:</strong> Unlikely in 2025, but odds climb moderately thereafter, especially with softness in key trading partners (Europe, Japan, UK).</li>
<li><strong>GDP Growth:</strong> US growth to continue but slow, with base case for 1–2.5% in 2025. A soft landing remains probable.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market:</strong> Unemployment creeping higher, reflecting less robust jobs growth, but catastrophic losses unlikely; wage growth may barely outpace inflation.</li>
<li><strong>China/EM:</strong> China’s manufacturing weak but stabilizing; India/China relationship warming could support regional trade, but global demand remains soft.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Implications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Defensive US exposure, selective overweighting of services/healthcare/utilities.</li>
<li>EM currencies (peso, real) face continued depreciation; commodity exposure offers only tactical relief.</li>
<li>US-listed MNCs with China/India exposure face more regulatory/political risk than immediate trade upside.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Climate &amp; Energy Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Climate Goals Slippage:</strong> US and EU both unlikely to hit announced 2030 targets; India is a relative bright spot. Global 2°C threshold will likely be breached well before 2050.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Mix:</strong> Oil and coal remain dominant in 2030's energy mix, despite renewable investment. Fossil fuel transition will underwhelm popular expectations.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation Effects:</strong> Persistent climate failings and energy shocks may further pressure prices, especially in insurance, food, and utilities.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors and Themes</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI IPO Watch:</strong> OpenAI is the leading candidate for a large tech IPO, but no announcement is imminent. Watch for capital markets risk-on/risk-off sentiment swings, especially as high-profile IPO windows can drive cyclical sector rotations.</li>
<li><strong>Tech Layoffs:</strong> Substantial increase in layoffs anticipated this year—high valuations and over-extended payrolls are being trimmed. This could further pressure consumer discretionary and urban real estate.</li>
<li><strong>Enterprise AI Race:</strong> Google and xAI look dominant in near-term large-model leadership, with Meta and Anthropic as challengers. AI hardware up-cycle continues: US chip production growth &gt;7% is highly probable.</li>
<li><strong>Antitrust:</strong> Both Amazon and Apple likely to face adverse judicial rulings related to monopoly status; continued regulatory headwinds for large consumer platforms.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Implications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Favor upstream tech (semis, specialized compute, data infrastructure) over end-user consumer tech.</li>
<li>Potential derating for mega-cap platforms; rotational flows towards growth-at-a-reasonable-price and non-advertising-reliant software names.</li>
<li>Layoffs provide further leverage for margin expansion, but signal weaker broader demand/advertising.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy, Resources &amp; Climate</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commodities:</strong> Oil prices face downside pressure year-end (low 60s/bbl possible), though whiplash volatility cannot be ruled out. Natural gas likely to be higher, reflecting supply constraints or extreme weather.</li>
<li><strong>Renewables:</strong> Solar installation momentum remains strong in the US, but unlikely to hit most optimistic targets for capacity expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Storage (Tesla):</strong> Battery/energy storage growth solid, but oversized near-term jumps are improbable.</li>
<li><strong>Utilities:</strong> Relative winners with persistent power demand, but capex and regulatory risk rising due to slow transition away from fossil fuels.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Implications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Short/mid-term energy rotation can be tactical, especially in natural gas and grid infrastructure.</li>
<li>Watch for underperformance from pure-play green tech bets (relative to expectations) until acceleration in policy or physical climate shocks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Estate</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Housing/Rents:</strong> Rents continue to climb in major cities (NYC, SF), though not at runaway rates. Higher rates and sticky inflation keep housing affordability tight—rental REITs favored over homebuilders.</li>
<li><strong>Commercial Real Estate:</strong> Implications from tech layoffs—less robust demand for urban office space.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Names &amp; Events</h2>
<h3>Company Specific</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple</strong>: Product cycle focus remains on iPhones and OS updates; hardware innovation (e.g., cellular laptops) likely, but major new category expansion is improbable this year. Regulatory pressure (monopoly findings) is an increasing headwind.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla</strong>: Truck production will grow, but no breakthrough on very low-cost models; delivery and energy storage numbers likely to disappoint versus early bull hopes. Remain selective, favoring supply chain or megatrend partners over direct auto play.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon &amp; Live Nation</strong>: Both under antitrust scrutiny; risk of regulatory-induced business model changes or fines is high.</li>
<li><strong>Netflix</strong>: Price hikes possible but not certain; content spend and margin management to be closely watched.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto (Bitcoin, Ripple, USDC, Tether)</strong>: High volatility; upside to $130k BTC is plausible in 2025 but higher targets (&gt;150k) look stretched. Institutional acceptance (Ripple ETF) likely. Some depegging risk for major stablecoins, but not near systemic levels.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics &amp; Other</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Middle East/Eastern Europe</strong>: Events (Gaza, Ukraine, Yemen) add to global tail risks—materials/energy/defense sectors must hedge for event-driven volatility.</li>
<li><strong>China/India</strong>: Recent partnership announcements reduce immediate escalation risk, but do not remove longer-term manufacturing/trade reshuffling.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Key Watch Points</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inflation and Fed cuts path:</strong> Two rate cuts most likely, but stickiness in core CPI can delay or limit magnitude—stagger rate/duration exposure accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Tech layoffs cascade:</strong> Indirect effects on advertising, spending, and urban service demand.</li>
<li><strong>Antitrust and regulatory risk:</strong> Platform valuation resets possible—embrace dispersion opportunities.</li>
<li><strong>Energy transition patience:</strong> Position for lumpy, policy-dependent adoption curves in green tech.</li>
<li><strong>Currency and EM devaluation:</strong> Emerging market FX under pressure; allocate accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical surprises:</strong> Maintain some optionality for rapidly escalating conflict or supply shocks.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br />
Prepare for a market environment defined by sticky inflation, gradual disinflationary policy, continued pressure on mega-cap tech valuations, modest earnings growth, geopolitical flare-ups, and bumpy progress on decarbonization. Tilt towards defensiveness, selective growth (AI infrastructure), tactical commodity/utility exposure, and barbell duration positioning. Avoid chasing narrative-driven upside in high-profile names without clear catalysts.</p>
