</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Policy</h2>
<h3>Economic Growth, Recession, and Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moderate US Growth Outlook:</strong> GDP growth for 2025 is widely expected to be sluggish, most likely around or under the low 2% range. Prospects for a significant &quot;Trump boom&quot; are being discussed, but consensus expects only modest outperformance.</li>
<li><strong>Soft Landing but High Uncertainty:</strong> The risk of a US recession starting before 2027 remains present, though not the base case. Near-term, labor market indicators and upcoming jobs data will be watched closely for early warning signs.</li>
<li><strong>Rates Path:</strong> Most scenarios do not foresee aggressive Fed hikes, and the expectation is for only a handful of rate cuts in 2025 (likely 1–2). Elevated but range-bound federal funds rate (&gt;3.25% but &lt;3.75%) is likely, which should have a cooling effect on housing and credit availability, but not trigger a credit crunch.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation Persistence:</strong> Both headline and core CPI are likely to stay elevated, predominantly in the low-to-mid 3% range. Notably, markets see it as virtually certain that inflation will stay above 3%—well above the Fed’s target. Markets do not anticipate a high likelihood of a sudden inflation spike (&gt;6%), but sticky price pressures will likely remain a theme impacting consumer and wage negotiations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal &amp; Federal Spending</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debt Trajectory:</strong> The US national debt continues to climb, plausibly exceeding $38 trillion by year-end and moving toward $40 trillion or higher under Trump’s term. Meaningful fiscal consolidation (deep spending cuts) is not expected, even with renewed political focus.</li>
<li><strong>Government Shutdown Risk:</strong> High headline risk as Congress reconvenes, with a government shutdown widely discussed.</li>
<li><strong>Tax Policy:</strong> No broad-based tax cuts for high earners are expected, minimizing major demand-side fiscal surprises.</li>
<li><strong>Trade/Tariffs:</strong> Legal rulings weakening Trump-era tariffs create additional uncertainty for global supply chains; these may feed into both cost structures and currency volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Union and Labor Policy:</strong> Weakening of union strength could tamp down wage growth pressure, with indirect impact on consumption.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US-China-India-Russia Axis:</strong> Increasing energy and strategic cooperation among India, China, and Russia suggests further bifurcation of global supply chains, and may sustain the current demand for fossil fuels and non-US dollar reserves.</li>
<li><strong>Military Risks:</strong> Low but non-negligible likelihoods of military conflict in East Asia (China-Taiwan, China-Philippines), as well as Russia-related risk in Europe. First-order effects are still muted but defense sector resilience and energy hedging remain prudent.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Implications</h2>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fossil Fuels Endure:</strong> Oil and coal are likely to remain the world’s largest sources of primary energy through 2030—expectation of a swift renewables takeover is unsupported by consensus. India-Russia ties and US policy shifts only reinforce that status quo.</li>
<li><strong>Oil Prices:</strong> High volatility: There is significant two-way risk on crude, with meaningful probability of both a downward swing (sub-$65 WTI) and the potential for spikes above $80 if shocks (e.g., geopolitical) occur. For now, the base case is subdued.</li>
<li><strong>Natural Gas:</strong> High likelihood of price rebounds above $4–$5 in 2025, which may benefit US producers and international exporters.</li>
<li><strong>Renewables:</strong> US solar capacity is likely to continue expanding, but not at an exponential (hypergrowth) rate. Renewables stocks may remain sentiment-driven, with policy catalysts lacking.</li>
<li><strong>Gold/Commodities:</strong> Elevated inflation expectations support a role for inflation hedges.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials &amp; Real Estate</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yields:</strong> Treasury yields unlikely to see sharp spikes above 5% near-term, reflecting stable if elevated inflation and rates.</li>
<li><strong>Housing/Rents:</strong> Rising rents in key urban centers—particularly New York—favors REITs and urban property holders. San Francisco growth remains positive but less pronounced.</li>
<li><strong>Government Shutdown/Spending Uncertainty:</strong> May create near-term volatility for financials with high US exposure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Leadership:</strong> Big Tech remains dominant; there is no indication that S&amp;P 500's concentration in the &quot;Magnificent 7&quot; will dissipate in 2025. Niche sectors (AI, semiconductors) continue to drive index performance.</li>
<li><strong>AI/Semiconductors:</strong> Nvidia appears favored to remain the world's largest company by year-end, strongly benefitting from AI and high-performance compute tailwinds. Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Tesla are long shots for dethroning Nvidia in market cap.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong> Institutional adoption of Bitcoin continues, with significant likelihood of further treasury allocation from major S&amp;P 500 firms. However, no consensus on a &quot;moonshot&quot; for Bitcoin or Ethereum (e.g., &gt;$150k BTC, &gt;$8k ETH) by year-end, with more moderate upside in play.</li>
<li><strong>Mobility:</strong> No major disruption to Uber’s SF market share by Waymo is anticipated in the short term.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Consumer</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Healthcare Policy:</strong> Momentum in rescheduling cannabis reflects a shifting regulatory environment but not a consensus move yet.</li>
<li><strong>Pharmaceuticals:</strong> Political scrutiny over drug pricing is on the rise, with direct statements from the White House. Expect defensive posturing from drugmakers.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer Strength:</strong> Despite inflation, wage growth is expected to at least keep pace, supporting consumption, but squeezed margins may persist in low-end retail and services sectors.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Companies</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia:</strong> Strong prospects as global market leader; AI/semiconductor tailwinds remain exceptionally robust.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Tesla:</strong> Less likely to lead market cap rankings in 2025; may underperform expectations if sentiment rotates out of ultra-megacap tech.</li>
<li><strong>Uber/Waymo:</strong> Incumbency remains strong for Uber in mobility; no major disruption from autonomous entrants expected this year.</li>
<li><strong>Cannabis (Tilray, MSOS):</strong> Optionality on rescheduling, but catalyst not assured. Monitor for further federal or state-level signals.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Summary Table: Short-Term Risks and Opportunities</h2>
<p>| Theme             | Directional Impact | Thesis Highlights                                      |
|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Rates             | Neutral/Moderate  | Few cuts, no hikes; higher-for-longer policy likely    |
| Inflation         | Moderately High   | Sticky inflation, above-target, supporting TIPS/hedge  |
| Oil/Commodities   | Mixed             | Volatility high, directional conviction limited        |
| Tech/Growth       | Strong            | AI, semis, &quot;Magnificent 7&quot; dominance continues        |
| Macro Downside    | Moderate          | Risks linger (shutdown, policy, inflation, geopolitics)|
| Dollar/FX         | Uncertain         | Tariffs and global realignment create cross-currents   |
| Real Estate/REITs | Stable-to-Positive| Rents rising, especially in NYC and SF                 |
| Crypto            | Positive Bias     | Institutional adoption grows, upside not exponential   |
| Healthcare        | Defensive         | Policy risk (pricing), slow movement on cannabis       |
| Energy            | Rangebound        | Fossil fuels endure, US solar growth moderate          |</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Tactical Note:</strong> Investors should maintain diversified exposure, watch key labor and inflation signals, and be alert to policy/political shocks (congressional standoffs, global energy axis shifts). Tech and select commodities continue to offer asymmetric upside, but vigilance on elevated macro tail-risk is warranted.</p>
