</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro Overview</h2>
<h3>Rates, Growth &amp; Inflation</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Monetary Policy Direction:</strong><br />
The environment is overwhelmingly in favor of continued easing. The Fed's latest cut, paired with low likelihood of additional cuts or any hikes this year, signals a more accommodative stance. There is little anticipation of recession or emergency rate moves. Base expectations: steady, gradual monetary softening, not an aggressive easing cycle.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Second Order:</strong> As soft landings persist and no strong recession triggers are expected, broad equity indices may retain upward bias, while fixed income, especially at longer maturities, faces moderate upside risk if inflation remains controlled.</li>
<li><strong>Third Order:</strong> Easing financial conditions may boost risk assets further (equities, high yield), but return expectations for Treasuries and cash-rich near-term bonds may underperform without duration/credit risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fiscal &amp; Geopolitical Backdrop:</strong><br />
Little risk seen for US debt default or abrupt fiscal cliff. Nonetheless, increased political volatility and unresolved geopolitical tensions (Russia/Ukraine, Middle East, Sino-Indian border) could spark flight-to-safety episodes, but these are currently not central base cases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector and Thematic Views</h2>
<h3>Financials &amp; Payments</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fintech/Payments:</strong> A new major payments launch is expected in 2025, which could further consolidate card/payment technology advantage for incumbents familiar with rapid product cycles.</li>
<li><strong>Credit/Consumer:</strong> Consumer health remains strong; Amex raises Platinum fees and adds perks, indicating robust affluent demand.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology/AI/Semiconductors</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>AI &amp; Chipmakers:</strong><br />
Nvidia and Intel’s collaboration signals ongoing AI-driven CAPEX and innovation. Nvidia is highly likely to retain global megacap leadership (relative to Microsoft, Apple, Amazon). Google continues to dominate in AI, with Meta innovating in wearables and Apple’s mobile strategy facing product feedback challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Second Order:</strong> AI infrastructure, datacenters, and suppliers for advanced chips/cooling will see amplified demand.</li>
<li><strong>Third Order:</strong> Watch for further ripple effects in labor (reskilling), real estate (datacenter buildouts), and supply chain upgrades across industrials and utilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consumer Tech:</strong><br />
Despite Apple’s near-term software issues, no major hardware disruption (foldables) is likely this year. Focus remains on iterative, not revolutionary, product cycles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy / Automotives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>EV Growth:</strong><br />
Hyundai’s US investment underscores ongoing transition to EV/hybrids even as policy and trade environments remain volatile. Continued capital spending supports US manufacturing and electrification themes.
<ul>
<li><strong>Second Order:</strong> Persistent incentives and capacity buildout may tighten supply chains for EV batteries/minerals, helping related commodity plays.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Regulated Markets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Healthcare Policy:</strong><br />
US states and regions are building independent coalitions in response to federal guidance changes, notably around vaccines. Sector remains policy-sensitive, and rapid state/federal shifts could create uncertainty for payors/providers.</li>
<li><strong>Cannabis:</strong><br />
Weed rescheduling lacks momentum near-term, suggesting minimal regulatory upside for listed cannabis equities for now.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Digital Assets</h2>
<h3>Crypto Momentum</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum:</strong><br />
Probabilities favor continued upside in BTC and ETH, with both having a good chance to hit new all-time highs through year-end. Extreme upside (e.g., BTC $200k+) is less likely in 2025 but medium-term positive skew persists. Little risk seen for return to bear market lows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No Major Protocol Upgrades for Bitcoin:</strong><br />
No material technical changes likely for BTC or ETH this year; narrative remains price/macro-driven rather than feature-driven.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Altcoins:</strong><br />
Solana has notable price upside potential but less certainty than BTC/ETH. Ethereum’s product momentum remains robust.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Second Order:</strong> Crypto’s resilience, despite a more stable macro backdrop, could reinforce demand for related equities (exchanges, miners, blockchain infrastructure).</li>
<li><strong>Third Order:</strong> Institutional adoption (e.g. more ETF flows) could accelerate if macro stays supportive and regulatory status remains stable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company and Event Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia:</strong> Clear favorite to cement its status as world’s largest public company, capitalizing on AI hardware, partnerships, and investments.</li>
<li><strong>Intel:</strong> Receives transformative boost from Nvidia as a partner/investor, positioning for datacenter/AI-centric growth.</li>
<li><strong>Apple:</strong> Short-term product reputation risk from iOS issues, but no major disruption to financials/emerging categories.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet:</strong> Unlikely to supplant Nvidia’s pole position in near term; core business models remain robust.</li>
<li><strong>Coinbase:</strong> No near-term managerial risk or sector shakeup expected, as crypto sector continues to operate with strong fundamental tailwinds.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare names:</strong> Watch regional payors/providers amid state-level divergence from CDC and new coalition risk.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitics &amp; Exogenous Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>US &amp; UK Politics:</strong><br />
Political risk skew remains elevated but not urgent; focus is on policy implementation twists, especially from Trump administration volatility and UK/EU relations (e.g., Palestine statehood moves).</li>
<li><strong>Middle East:</strong><br />
Israeli military operations are escalating but presently not pricing in full regional war spillover; remain vigilant for acute oil/energy market volatility or sectors tied to crisis escalation.</li>
<li><strong>Weather and Catastrophe Risk:</strong><br />
Hurricane season likely busier than usual—monitor insurance and catastrophe bond exposures, especially for reinsurance- and disaster-sensitive assets/regions.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Summary Actions &amp; Watchlist</h2>
<ul>
<li>Maintain pro-risk stance in equities, especially tech megacaps/AI/semis, against a backdrop of softening but not aggressively loose policy.</li>
<li>Consider selective exposure to US EV/industrial/manufacturing re-shoring/battery supply chains.</li>
<li>For digital assets, holding BTC/ETH continues to be supported by positive momentum, but set expectations for sharp volatility.</li>
<li>Remain alert to geopolitical flashpoints (especially Middle East, Ukraine, and Asia) and their second-order impacts on energy and defense.</li>
<li>Watch for policy and regulatory curveballs in healthcare (potential for volatility as states diverge from federal standards) and fintech/payments.</li>
<li>Insurance/REITs with catastrophe exposure need to be stress tested for above-average hurricane season claims risk.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overall, the outlook is one of moderate optimism for risk assets and technology themes, with a watchful eye on policy twists and geopolitical shocks.</strong></p>
