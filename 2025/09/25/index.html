<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Policy View</h2>
<h3>US Macroeconomics &amp; Fiscal Outlook</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stagnation/Moderation Ahead</strong>: Current consensus expects modest US GDP growth in 2025 (1-2%), with neither a sharp boom nor deep recession expected—however, risk of recession before 2027 is still notable, especially given fiscal tightening and political impasses.</li>
<li><strong>Deficit Trajectory Worsening</strong>: US national debt will likely breach $38T before year-end and possibly reach $50T this administration—spending cuts are possible but unlikely to curb the debt curve meaningfully. This amplifies long-term currency and bond risk.</li>
<li><strong>Shutdown Fallout Risks</strong>: Looming shutdown could disrupt economic activity and markets if prolonged, especially with threats of mass layoffs and reduced government services. Political stand-offs heighten policy unpredictability and may dampen confidence.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inflation &amp; Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inflation Plateauing at Elevated Levels</strong>: Expect inflation and core CPI to stay elevated (high-2% to mid-3% range YoY into late 2025). No signs of deflation; energy and housing remain upside drivers.</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rate Cycle</strong>: Multiple Fed cuts likely (3 expected in 2025), totaling ~75bp reduction; aggressive (5+) cuts are unlikely barring severe shock. Market expects rates to move to 3.25–3.75% range through 2026—a gradual, cautious Fed, not an accommodation pivot.</li>
<li><strong>Recession Watch</strong>: Material risk remains for a cyclical US or global recession before 2027. EU/UK/Japan face higher near-term recession odds versus US, while China and India are more insulated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Employment &amp; Social</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unemployment Risks</strong>: Elevated probability of US unemployment ticking above 8% before 2030, reflecting both cyclical slowdown risk and long-term automation/disruption. Above-10% levels are less likely but cannot be ruled out with severe shocks (e.g., policy errors, major tech contraction).</li>
<li><strong>Education Decline</strong>: US reading and math test scores are unlikely to improve by 2026; ongoing declines highlight broadening human capital challenges impacting productivity and long-term growth.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitics, International, &amp; Trade</h2>
<h3>Trade and Tariffs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tariff Waves Incoming</strong>: High odds of substantial, broad-based US tariffs on major economies in 2025—including China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Mexico, and EU (esp. Germany). This will exacerbate global supply chain strains and create inflationary pressures.</li>
<li><strong>Semiconductor/Pharma/Automotive at Risk</strong>: Sectors most exposed to tariffs are advanced manufacturing, tech/semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals. Expect manufacturing margin compression and potential supply/demand distortion in affected sectors.</li>
<li><strong>China/US Pressures</strong>: China unlikely to surpass the US economy by 2030, but bilateral tensions and decoupling risks to FX stability and trade-dependent sectors remain elevated. China doubling down on climate opens room for green tech and export shifts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil Markets</strong>: WTI crude likely to stay sub-$65 by late 2025; sharp spikes above $80 are improbable without major geopolitical incident (e.g., Iran closing Strait of Hormuz, which remains a low risk scenario). US gas prices likely moderate, but California may see elevated swings due to regional policy and refining constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Transition Metals &amp; Renewables</strong>: US government's move towards stakes in lithium supply chains indicates accelerating push in energy transition—potential tailwind for select US miners and EV supply chain participants amid protectionism.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Key Sectors &amp; Asset Classes</h2>
<h3>Equities (US)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Volatility &amp; Correction Risk</strong>: Moderate risk of market correction; a circuit-breaker-level crash this year remains low, but not negligible amid political and global macro uncertainties.</li>
<li><strong>Policy-Driven Opportunities/Risks</strong>: Key swing sectors: tech (vulnerable to both talent cost and tariffs); healthcare/pharma (tariff and regulatory uncertainty); energy (dependent on policy and global demand trends); manufacturing (potential near-term revival if policy support appears, but skepticism warranted).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bond Market</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rates Likely Peaked</strong>: Steps toward incremental Fed cuts support intermediate-term duration, but persistent deficit and uncertain fiscal discipline remain a drag on long-end treasuries. Credit spreads could widen if recession risk manifests.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>BTC/ETH Upside</strong>: Expect significant volatility but overall positive trajectory for BTC and ETH, with BTC flirting with $130k and ETH aiming at/above $5k by year-end. Regulatory risk and systemic stablecoin event are low-probability, but always present tail risk.</li>
<li><strong>Tether/Stablecoins</strong>: No imminent sign of stablecoin depegging/insolvency, but increased institutional scrutiny may pressure market structure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gold/Safe Havens</strong>: Not prominent in headlines, but remain a defensive play given persistent fiscal risk, global political uncertainty, and latent inflation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Assets &amp; Insurance</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Climate/Catastrophe</strong>: Large-scale natural disasters remain base-case risks (notably hurricanes/typhoons); insurance and reinsurance sectors should watch for loss events but no immediate abnormal spike expected.</li>
<li><strong>REITs</strong>: Implied recession risk in developed markets is a headwind; fiscal policy/political gridlock may further dent commercial real estate confidence.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tech &amp; Supply Chain</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tech Volatility</strong>: Asia/US tech names face near-term pressure due to US policy (H-1B, tariffs), cyclical COVID and geopolitical factors. Qualcomm and AI supply chain innovation continue but face macro headwinds.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Names &amp; Themes to Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lithium Americas</strong>: Sudden US government interest suggests potential re-rating, underlining new energy nationalism and critical mineral focus.</li>
<li><strong>Qualcomm</strong>: Launches new AI chips for PCs, signaling continuing arms race in AI hardware but with short-term margin and demand uncertainty.</li>
<li><strong>Xcel Energy</strong>: Settles major fire lawsuit; utility and insurance names face tail event risk linked to climate change.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare &amp; Biotech</strong>: Biotech innovation shines (Huntington’s gene therapy breakthrough), but sector faces pricing and regulatory concerns amid tough US political climate.</li>
<li><strong>Airlines/Travel</strong>: Minor risk from travel bans, ongoing policy/political volatility, and regional security (Europe, Middle East).</li>
<li><strong>Consumer Discretionary</strong>: Watch for tariffs or policy headwinds targeting EU/Asia consumer goods and luxury sectors.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Investment Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stay Selective in US Equities</strong>: Potential for sideways/volatile market, driven by policy swings and global shocks. Focus on quality, strong balance sheets, and limited supply chain exposure.</li>
<li><strong>Manage Bond Duration Cautiously</strong>: Anticipate modest Fed cuts but beware fiscal slippage keeping long yields sticky.</li>
<li><strong>Lean Defensive When Justified</strong>: Elevated geopolitical, policy, and climate risks warrant core exposure to safe havens and real assets for downside protection.</li>
<li><strong>Tactical Crypto Allocation Reasonable</strong>: BTC/ETH likely to outperform risk assets, but allocate amid volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor Key Policy Inflection Points</strong>: Upcoming government shutdowns, tariff waves, and energy transition policies are the top watch items for new opportunities and tail risks across portfolios.</li>
