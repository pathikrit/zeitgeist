</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Market Outlook</h2>
<h3>Economic Growth &amp; Employment</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soft Landing Base Case</strong>: Strong consensus that the US economy will achieve a soft landing by end-2025: low-to-moderate GDP growth (around 1.5–2.5%), subdued but persistent inflation, and a largely stable labor market.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation Moderation</strong>: Both CPI and core inflation are widely expected to stay between 3–3.5% next year, with further upside risk from persistent services inflation and energy volatility. However, chances of a 1970s-style stagflation, double-dip recession, or runaway price growth are now regarded as very low.</li>
<li><strong>Unemployment</strong>: The probability of US unemployment spiking above 5% by Sep 2025 is low, but a modest uptick to the 4–4.5% range seems highly likely. Labor force growth and churn may pressure wage gains, but widespread job losses are not anticipated in the near term.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal and Monetary Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Immediate Fed Rate Moves</strong>: Clear expectation that the Fed will not hike rates in 2025, and rate cuts—if any—are likely limited in size (three cuts at most now seen as the ceiling scenario, with the median outcome closer to zero or one, depending on late-year inflation prints).</li>
<li><strong>US Debt Still Rising</strong>: The US national debt is expected to exceed $38T by year-end 2025, mitigating the impact of any near-term fiscal austerity or budget cuts. Risks of a technical default remain remote.</li>
<li><strong>Government Dysfunction</strong>: The risk of sustained government shutdowns is significant this quarter, with direct spillovers for public sector contractors, federal services, and short-term macro sentiment. Indirect second-order effects could surface through delayed payments, credit downgrades, and general risk aversion.</li>
<li><strong>Global Divergence</strong>: Mild to moderate recession risk remains elevated for Japan, Germany, and the UK, with knock-on effects for global demand, FX markets (JPY, GBP, EUR), and global trade.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Impacts</h2>
<h3>Commodities &amp; Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fossil Fuels Remain Dominant</strong>: By 2030, oil and coal are expected to retain their lead as the world’s prevailing energy sources, with only incremental transition to renewables. This bodes well for traditional energy producers and supporting infrastructure, but creates growing policy and ESG risk over the medium term.</li>
<li><strong>Delayed Solar Ramp</strong>: Large annual increases in solar capacity are anticipated, but most forecasts expect the US to miss aggressive 70 GW/year targets; nearer to 30–40 GW in 2025, with upside risk from policy acceleration.</li>
<li><strong>Raw Materials/EV Transition</strong>: US interest in Lithium Americas points to rising state involvement in strategic minerals. This may support domestic lithium supply chains and select mining equities, but could trigger retaliatory measures by international players or raise local regulatory scrutiny.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials &amp; Real Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Banking Leadership</strong>: Key succession at JPMorgan remains unresolved, but with likely continuity candidates; sector-wide impacts limited unless there’s a surprise external appointment.</li>
<li><strong>ETF/Asset Management Growth</strong>: BlackRock projected to report record AUM, strength in digital assets/ETFs, solid net inflows, and higher performance fee revenue but with a watchful eye on private market dynamics and merger activity. Margin compression and regulatory discussions remain minor headwinds.</li>
<li><strong>REITs/California Risks</strong>: Renewed speculation about California secession and above-average earthquake risk may put local property and REIT names at a valuation discount versus national peers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI &amp; Legal Friction</strong>: Tech giants (Tesla, Alphabet, possibly Apple, Amazon, Microsoft) face elevated regulatory scrutiny in the US, with risk of FTC investigations increasing. Any OpenAI tort payout could set wider precedent for AI firm liability.</li>
<li><strong>Upcoming IPOs</strong>: Stripe and OpenAI remain probable but not imminent public listings. Tech IPO activity is returning but still far from a 2021-style boom.</li>
<li><strong>Hardware Shifts</strong>: Apple and Intel relationship speculation, combined with new Qualcomm and Apple hardware launches, reinforces pressure on semiconductor and smartphone supply chains.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin</strong>: Probability leans toward Bitcoin trading well below $150k by end-2025, but hitting or exceeding $130k appears plausible. Ethereum faces similar capped upside.</li>
<li><strong>Inflows/ETF/Index Participation</strong>: Expect institutional flows to crypto- and digital-asset-related ETFs and funds to gradually rise, aided by BlackRock’s growing commitment to digital assets.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breakthroughs Gaining Steam</strong>: High-impact news on Huntington’s and HIV therapies supports a tailwind for biotechs with exposure to gene editing, neurology, immunology, and infectious disease.</li>
<li><strong>Global Vaccine Outlook</strong>: Continued emphasis on childhood and public health vaccines, as well as new focus on drug-resistant bacteria, may create rotation among pharma names.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Focused Risks &amp; Opportunities</h2>
<h3>Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heightened Tensions</strong>: Russia-related airspace incursions, European anxiety over US engagement in Ukraine, and new forms of hybrid warfare in Europe highlight ongoing volatility and defense sector relevance.</li>
<li><strong>China/US Thaw Uncertain</strong>: Xi Jinping’s near-term US visit looks unlikely, suggesting no imminent improvement in CNY/USD directionality or policy risk.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Climate &amp; Natural Disaster</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Physical Risk Escalation</strong>: Crossing 2°C warming before 2050 is increasingly likely, feeding into higher costs for reinsurance, insurance, agriculture, and supply chains worldwide. US earthquake risk (especially in Japan, but also California) remains a non-trivial tail risk for insurers and real assets.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Names of Note</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>JPMorgan</strong>: Succession developments are unlikely to unsettle markets, but a surprise in appointment could be a catalyst.</li>
<li><strong>Starbucks</strong>: Store closures and job cuts highlight growing secular headwinds in consumer/retail.</li>
<li><strong>Apple, Intel</strong>: Strategic partnership and capital needs may create new opportunities (or risks) for suppliers and semiconductor ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft</strong>: Regulatory headline risk as FTC and global regulators ramp up scrutiny of market power.</li>
<li><strong>Lithium Americas</strong>: Potential for re-rating if US government stake/industrial policy goes through; echoes themes of energy security and reshoring.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI/Stripe</strong>: Legals and IPO timing tricky; valuations at listing could serve as a bellwether for overall AI/fintech sentiment.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Synthesis: Key Near-Term Investment Themes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Position for a soft-landing US macro outlook but stay vigilant for policy-driven volatility (shutdowns, debt ceiling, late-2025 inflation surprises).</li>
<li>Favor energy, defense, commodity, and digital asset themes for incremental capital allocation. Underweight Eurozone/UK and Japan due to persistent recession risk and currency volatility.</li>
<li>Stay alert to regulatory, legal, and natural disaster shocks in large-cap tech, REITs with California exposure, and global insurance.</li>
<li>Secular tailwinds in healthcare/biotech, aided by new gene/editing breakthroughs and infectious disease developments.</li>
<li>Remain cautious on immediate tech IPOs and hardware supply chain names until visibility improves; monitor crypto as a high-beta satellite.</li>
</ul>
