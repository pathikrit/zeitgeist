<hr />
<h2>Macroeconomic and Policy Outlook</h2>
<h3>US Economy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recession probability for 2025 remains low.</strong> GDP growth likely to be moderate, strengthening the ‘soft-landing’ narrative.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Expected at 2-3% in 2025, not breaching 4%—limits urgency for monetary tightening. Fed is widely expected not to hike rates, and odds strongly favor three rate cuts this year.</li>
<li><strong>US debt:</strong> Federal deficits will remain historically high, with the national debt surpassing $38T by year-end. This implies future yield curve pressure and elevated sovereign risk discussions, but without imminent funding crisis.</li>
<li><strong>Labor market:</strong> Unemployment risk rises moderately by 2030, likely cresting above 6-7% but not spiking to crisis levels in the near term. Tight immigration policy changes (H-1B fee) could increase labor shortages in tech and skilled sectors, adding to wage and inflation pressures.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Dynamics &amp; Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US-China relations:</strong> Odds are against China overtaking the US economy by 2030; continued Western skepticism about China’s emissions actions could hinder coordination on climate and supply chains. Risks from conflict in South China Sea or with India remain tail events.</li>
<li><strong>Russia/Ukraine:</strong> Conflict will continue to disrupt European energy and agricultural markets. No imminent ceasefire expected.</li>
<li><strong>Trade:</strong> High probability of new US free trade agreements and a halving of the trade deficit through industrial and tariff policies. This could benefit US manufacturing, supply chain reshoring, and certain export sectors.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Thematic &amp; Sector Outlook</h2>
<h3>Energy, Climate &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fossil fuels will remain dominant for the decade,</strong> with oil/coal outpacing renewables as global energy sources through 2030. This supports outperformance of traditional energy and possible supply/demand tailwinds for related commodities.</li>
<li><strong>Clean tech &amp; metals:</strong> Lithium market volatility, US interest in mining, and global EV demand momentum continue. EVs are very likely to capture well over 20% market share by 2030, though not yet majority—battery, critical mineral, and related supply chain plays still favored, but volatility is a feature.</li>
<li><strong>Climate policy:</strong> World likely to surpass 2°C warming before 2050, with limited odds the EU or China will hit their short-term targets. This creates ongoing risk of abrupt regulatory changes, carbon pricing, and insurance premium surges for climate-exposed sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Utilities/Nuclear:</strong> Probability is rising for nuclear data centers on military bases before 2030, reflecting new growth pathways for utilities and energy infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tech &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI IPO waves:</strong> Ramp and OpenAI are most likely to lead the next big IPOs in fintech and AI sectors, reinforcing public market interest. AI hardware winners will still benefit, despite recent market pullbacks and capital intensity concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Tech regulation:</strong> Growing US/EU focus on mega-cap tech antitrust (Amazon, Apple, Live Nation) could create meaningful headline and valuation risk for largest platforms. Tail risks of government intervention in AI, and public company leadership turnover, should not be overlooked.</li>
<li><strong>Semiconductors/chips:</strong> Intel-Apple investment talks show competitive urgency and shifting alliances; opportunity for select chipmakers but increasing sector polarization.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Biotech</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breakthrough therapies:</strong> New progress on gene therapies (Huntington’s, diabetes) drives large swings in biotech valuations, despite low probability of FDA-approved cures in the very near-term. Rising superbug infections in the US may accelerate infection control and pharma spending.</li>
<li><strong>Pharma regulation:</strong> Regulatory/legislative actions (weed rescheduling, vaccine schedule reforms) will be catalysts, creating both supply/demand and reimbursement risks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Insurance &amp; Real Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Catastrophe risk:</strong> Frequency of wildfires, severe storms, and earthquake risks (notably in Japan and Pacific) could drive higher insurance and reinsurance premiums, affecting both property/real estate exposures and insurer profitability.</li>
<li><strong>Legal risk:</strong> Ongoing litigation spikes (airline, government, utility) increase risk premia in select sectors.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company-Specific &amp; Event Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tesla/mega-caps:</strong> Staggering individual wealth accumulation expected (world’s first half-trillionaire likely by 2027), reflecting concentrated upside for mega-cap tech, but mindful of rising antitrust/regulatory attention.</li>
<li><strong>JPMorgan:</strong> CEO transition odds favor Marianne Lake or Troy Rohrbaugh; monitor for re-rating risk around decision.</li>
<li><strong>Live Nation, Amazon, Apple:</strong> All face high odds of antitrust liability determinations in coming years. Monitor for forced structural remedies or changes to platform business models.</li>
<li><strong>Lithium Americas:</strong> Government stake/loan signals strategic value, may become a policy-driven bellwether.</li>
<li><strong>Xcel Energy:</strong> Large wildfire settlement highlights real asset and utility legal risk amid severe weather events.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Notable Tail Risks</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geopolitical:</strong> Nuclear, meteor, and major regional conflict risks remain remote but not negligible through decade end.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong> Systemic risk from Tether and other large stablecoins remains low for 2025, but regulatory and structural vulnerabilities persist.</li>
<li><strong>Climate &amp; Catastrophe:</strong> High probability for climate overshoot pre-2050—insurance, real assets, and commodity hedges remain prudent.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Summary Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Expect more accommodative US monetary policy in 2025, supportive of equities and risk assets but stay alert for yield curve and sovereign risk volatility.</li>
<li>Energy, resources, and infrastructure sectors are well-positioned versus renewables and utilities, given policy inertia and supply/demand realities.</li>
<li>AI, fintech, and select biotech hold long-term upside, but face regulatory, antitrust, and capital intensity risks in the short to medium term.</li>
<li>Watch for policy-driven opportunities and disruptions, especially in trade/industrial, antitrust, healthcare, and tech hardware.</li>
<li>Real asset and insurance exposures require ongoing climate/catastrophe risk stress-testing, especially in Asia-Pacific and US wildfire zones.</li>
<li>Keep a defensive tilt towards sectors/companies resilient to regulatory and macro fluctuations, while watching for tactical re-entry into tech after recent pullbacks.</li>
</ul>
