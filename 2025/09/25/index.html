<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Broad Market Outlook</h2>
<h3>Economic Growth &amp; Labor Market</h3>
<ul>
<li>The US economy is outperforming expectations in Q2, driven primarily by robust consumer activity. This suggests low immediate risk of a broad recession, consistent with muted probability of recession or rapid GDP deceleration into 2026.</li>
<li>The labor market outlook faces some medium-term headwinds. There is elevated concern about unemployment rising beyond historical averages before 2030, with notable risk that it could exceed 7%, and material odds of reaching double digits over the next five years.
<ul>
<li>Watch for leading indicators from consumer spending and corporate profit trends for signs of labor market softening.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Government Policy &amp; Fiscal</h3>
<ul>
<li>The probability of a significant increase in US national debt remains high. Debt levels are almost certain to surpass $38T this year and may peak much higher in the coming administration. This will pressure Treasury markets and may spur inflation expectations and further focus on TIPS and long-duration debt.</li>
<li>Large tariff revenues are expected in 2025, indicating ongoing or expanded trade restrictions may impact manufacturing/SMEs and contribute to inflation stickiness.</li>
<li>Government shutdown risk is pronounced. Even short-term disruptions may weigh on consumer/investor confidence and slow Q4/Q1 growth momentum, particularly for companies exposed to federal spending.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fed &amp; Monetary Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Policy trajectory remains stable, with limited risk of emergency meetings or rate hikes in 2025.</li>
<li>Rate cut expectations tilt toward a moderate path (2-3 cuts in 2025). This scenario supports continued easing but makes a rapid pivot to stimulus unlikely barring an external shock.</li>
<li>Ongoing scrutiny of the Fed from both legal and political channels (e.g., Supreme Court/Fed Governor disputes) raises long-term policy uncertainty, but no near-term structural change in rates is anticipated.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Thematic Takeaways</h2>
<h3>Tech &amp; Antitrust</h3>
<ul>
<li>Legal and regulatory risk is intensifying for major tech platforms. Amazon's billion-dollar settlement on Prime practices may herald broader crackdowns, and courts are likely to rule on Apple's monopoly status before 2030.</li>
<li>Investors in platform tech giants ($AMZN, $AAPL) should expect episodic volatility linked to litigation headlines and evolving antitrust environment.</li>
<li>AI and private tech IPO activity is gathering momentum. OpenAI is the leading candidate for a major listing, ahead of Anthropic and others, but overall IPO window remains difficult and drawn out; limited near-term participation in new listings likely.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Industrials, Defense &amp; Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rare US military summits plus growing concerns about hybrid threats (e.g., Danish drone incidents) underscore heightened national security focus, possibly boosting defense-related equities and utilities (including nuclear infrastructure).</li>
<li>Pending nuclear-powered data center initiatives reflect state-backed tech/energy convergence and may benefit utilities, specialized REITs, and engineering firms.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li>US healthcare reform risk remains, but chances of a near-term Obamacare repeal are moderate. Significant disruption to major health insurers is unlikely before 2028.</li>
<li>Biotech innovation continues to make headlines (e.g., gene therapies for Huntington’s disease, HIV prevention efforts); sector-specific momentum favors R&amp;D-heavy names and companies with breakthrough pipelines.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy, Commodities, and Trade Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Elevated chance of tariffs on key commodities (notably copper). Mining and commodity names should prepare for number of US policy moves with inflationary implications.</li>
<li>Trade policy toward India and other EMs remains in flux, with moderate-to-high tariff risks that could affect multi-nation supply chains and select emerging market exposures.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Assets &amp; Catastrophe</h3>
<ul>
<li>Catastrophe risk remains a market narrative, with moderate-to-high likelihood of major earthquakes in Japan and some lower but notable odds in California. Insurance and REITs with direct regional exposures could face episodic repricing.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Region &amp; Key Risk Themes</h2>
<h3>Global Geopolitics &amp; Leadership</h3>
<ul>
<li>Stable short-term outlook for most G7 governments, supporting international markets. However, imminent leadership change in Japan could impact JPY and local equities, at minimum via sentiment.</li>
<li>No immediate resolution expected in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Status quo sustains risk premium in oil, wheat, and Eastern European/emerging market strategies.</li>
<li>US–China rivalry persists; no near-term crossover in GDP size, but ongoing EM risk remains material for trade/exposure-sensitive portfolios.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Judicial/US Political Landscape</h3>
<ul>
<li>Supreme Court composition is unlikely to change in size, but significant shift rightward is likely during new administration, with high probability of at least one high-profile judicial departure. This may influence longer-term legal/regulatory trends but has a muted immediate equity-market effect.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company-Specific, IPOs, and Micro Events</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tesla compensation package almost certain to pass, reducing near-term executive risk.</li>
<li>Starbucks undergoing major store/job restructuring, signaling retail cost pressure but also potential rebound post-reset.</li>
<li>Several high-profile tech and fintech IPOs (Ramp, OpenAI) on the horizon, but window remains highly selective—expect limited market impact near term.</li>
<li>Amazon/Apple headline risk remains elevated, with cash settlements and antitrust decision flow in focus.</li>
<li>Space commercial projects (Artemis, SpaceX) are progressing but not investment-accessible in public markets yet; little expectation for a SpaceX/Starlink IPO before late 2026.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Watchlist: Second/Third Order Effects</h2>
<ul>
<li>Government shutdown risk especially impacts consumer sentiment, sectoral earnings (especially defense and contractors), and may drive a short-term flight to quality in debt/real assets.</li>
<li>Persistent tariff environment can crowd out EM suppliers, hasten onshoring/reshoring, and amplify cost-push inflation.</li>
<li>Heightened disaster and geopolitical risk (nuclear, catastrophe, cyber/hybrid) strengthens long-duration hedges (commodities, gold, TIPS).</li>
<li>Ongoing labor/legal and antitrust actions at major platforms could catalyze sector rotation out of mega-cap tech, supporting portfolio diversification.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Action Items:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remain overweight quality US cyclicals while consumer spending persists, but monitor for labor market softening.</li>
<li>Maintain cautious exposure to large-cap tech; hedge with healthcare, defense, and select real asset plays.</li>
<li>Consider opportunistic allocations to sectors benefiting from public infrastructure/nuclear, but be mindful of regulatory and execution risk.</li>
<li>Monitor government shutdown, Fed commentary, major court decisions, and tariff announcements for inflection points.</li>
</ul>
