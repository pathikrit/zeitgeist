<h2>Macro &amp; Fed Policy</h2>
<h3>Economic Trajectory</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soft Landing Outlook:</strong> The prevailing view is a “soft landing” for the U.S. economy through 2025, with modest positive growth and no major recession anticipated. GDP is likeliest to run in the 1-2% range this year—supportive for risk assets but less so for aggressive value or deep cyclical rotation.</li>
<li><strong>Resilience In Labor Markets:</strong> Real wage growth is expected to be positive, supporting consumer spending, and unemployment is not forecasted to spike significantly.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Headline and core inflation are expected to remain sticky above 3% through 2025, continuing to constrain the Fed’s ability to cut rates quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Fed Rates Path:</strong> Markets anticipate some moderate rate cuts (2-3 over the next 16 months), but a rapid pivot is unlikely. Emergency measures or aggressive cuts remain very improbable unless an unforecasted shock occurs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short- to Medium-Term Equities:</strong> Large sell-offs in risk assets due to economic panic are unlikely, but sustained rallies could be capped by persistent inflation and restrictive monetary settings.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed Income:</strong> Bond yields may remain somewhat elevated. While modest cuts are likely priced in, a surprisingly hawkish path (due to inflation resilience) is a possible adverse scenario for duration-heavy portfolios.</li>
<li><strong>TIPS and inflation hedging:</strong> Inflation protection remains relevant; core and headline inflation measures are both projected to remain above traditional targets.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Fiscal, Politics &amp; Geopolitics</h2>
<h3>U.S. Fiscal &amp; Debt</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget Cuts:</strong> Significant staffing reductions are expected in the federal workforce in 2025, but large spending cuts ($1 trillion or more) remain an unlikely outcome, meaning deficits—and thus Treasury supply—will stay substantial.</li>
<li><strong>National Debt:</strong> U.S. national debt is headed toward $40-45 trillion during the coming administration, cementing a pro-supply backdrop for Treasury and agency debt markets.</li>
<li><strong>Trade &amp; Industrial Policy:</strong> Widespread new tariffs are expected on major trading partners (China, Mexico, Canada, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, EU), impacting manufacturing and potentially inflating costs for global supply chains—look for implications in automakers, semiconductors, machinery, and related sectors. Free-trade deals are less likely with China, but reasonably likely elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
<h3>International Tensions &amp; Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>China-Mexico-U.S. Triangle:</strong> Beijing warns of retaliation against Mexico’s planned tariffs; this could escalate into broader trade disruptions and supply chain re-routing, especially for autos and electronics.</li>
<li><strong>Russia, NATO, Eastern Europe:</strong> High alert in the region after Russian incursion over Polish airspace. While direct kinetic escalation is still improbable, defense and energy sectors may be affected by rising perceived threats and NATO commitments.</li>
<li><strong>Middle East:</strong> Trump-Qatar meeting after Israeli strike in Doha puts the region’s military and energy supply stability back in focus. Gulf states questioning U.S. protection signals possible future defense realignment or equipment/training investments.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Risk:</strong> Political violence and assassination attempts in the U.S. add to tail risks for risk assets and contribute to volatility premium in options and hedging markets.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector Focus</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI IPO Pipeline:</strong> OpenAI is expected to go public before Anthropic; a major liquidity event for the AI sector is on the horizon. This could spark a rerating for the broader AI theme and affect key suppliers (chipmakers, cloud infra).</li>
<li><strong>Tech Liability:</strong> High likelihood of significant legal claims (&gt;$1M) against major AI players (OpenAI) in the next three years. Regulatory intervention is less likely but remains a watch item; sudden government action could introduce left-tail risks.</li>
<li><strong>Tech Market Sentiment:</strong> Strong results from Apple and robust tech leadership in equity indices; Fed rate cut hopes are fueling this momentum but are not as aggressive as during past easing cycles.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil:</strong> Oil prices are most likely to drift lower—potentially slipping below $65 by year-end, though volatility remains high. Upside risk remains (e.g., geopolitical shock or OPEC intervention).</li>
<li><strong>Natural Gas:</strong> Prices are expected to rise well above $4. Room for long positioning or at least hedging expensive natural gas input exposure.</li>
<li><strong>Solar/Renewables:</strong> U.S. solar capacity install is on track for 30+ GWdc this year, favoring ongoing momentum for utility-scale and rooftop solar through 2026, but not at a pace suggesting an EV/solar “super-boom.”</li>
<li><strong>Inflation Input:</strong> Commodity price moderation, particularly in oil, may help cap headline inflation even if core inflation persists due to other input costs (especially labor and healthcare).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Insurance</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Costs:</strong> Surging health benefit costs (largest in 15 years) are expected in 2026, affecting consumers, employers, and insurers. Pass-through risk is high; margin pressure for hospital systems and insurance; possible positive for PBMs and cost-containment tech.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consumer &amp; Labor</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple Product Cycle:</strong> iPhone 17/Apple Watch 11 cycle likely to support continued strength for Apple and ecosystem suppliers. FDA approval for hypertension detection is a medium-term boost for Apple’s health services strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Strain:</strong> Immigration enforcement actions (e.g., Hyundai raid) and rising tariffs could further constrain manufacturing labor supply and increase wage pressure.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin:</strong> Most bets are on Bitcoin maintaining strong levels, with very low odds of a breakdown below $60,000. Room for significant upside (potential $100-150k+) remains robust; some S&amp;P 500 companies likely to allocate treasury to Bitcoin in late 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Ethereum:</strong> Also seen as maintaining $4,000+ pricing, with potential for $6,000 upward in a bull case, but extreme moonshot scenarios face skepticism.</li>
<li><strong>Macro Sensitivities:</strong> Crypto assets remain highly correlated to U.S. liquidity and risk appetite, but less to Fed policy than 2020-2023 cycles.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Company &amp; M&amp;A Events</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Media/Telecom:</strong> Paramount-Skydance’s bid for Warner Bros Discovery could spark further consolidation in the content production and streaming space. Look for knock-on effects for debt financing, asset bids, and competitive responses by Disney, Netflix, and Amazon.</li>
<li><strong>Apple:</strong> New products plus health feature clearance. Security concern flagged by French government (“spyware”) could create minor volatility.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI/Anthropic:</strong> IPOs and potential legal liabilities are key watchpoints for the private-to-public AI 'hyper growth' thesis.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare Players:</strong> Insurers and providers face strong headwinds from soaring costs, raising long-term questions for sector multiples.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Watchlist:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. policy/tariff announcements &amp; global trade retaliation (especially autos/semis)</li>
<li>Fed FOMC and political intervention signals (e.g., Lisa Cook dispute)</li>

<p><strong>Big Picture:</strong><br />
The U.S. remains in a late/mature cycle with sticky inflation, gentle macro deceleration, and robust liquidity for tech and risk assets. Geopolitical risks and fiscal slippage are creeping second-order threats, best hedged with diversified macro exposures and regular review of sector rotations.</p>
